"I like acting, I hope to be an actor, what about you? No, but someday. After I am done with school I plan to have a family. I hope so, how old are your kids? I would imagine. I am sure they a great kids. I wish I had more time to do stuff like that. Medical school is exhausting. "
"Oh really!? That is interesting. I am actually italian myself. Moving in a new place can be a lot of fun. Are you a good cook? Mmm That sounds delicious right now. Well I like tattoos and piercings, I am working on my next one right now. What would you get? Haha that is a cool idea."
"It's a little dog. Why is it the little ones always bark the most? I'd like to introduce that dog to my pet snakes. I think they'd eat him though! My snakes are both pythons. I feed them mice. Do you have any pets? You have mice running around your house? Yikes! I think I'd rather have the barking dogs than that. Have you given them names? If not, maybe we can come up with some. Now you really do need to get a cat and call him Tom."
"yes i do because i do not have a car a honda because they are affordable and reliable i do not think so, what about you? how did you lose it? im saving up to buy a new camera to take pictures of people who lost their licenses actually no, only people with long hair like mine"
"Yes, thank you. I think I just need some time to make it pass. Yes it does, especially during summer. I work at a ski resort. I love it! I have never been but I have heard the same. I love snow and the mountains. Haha, these days it is amazing where you can get cell service. Do you have any plans this weekend?"
"Yea, but to be perfectly honest, I actually don't work hard either. Well my problem is that I just never had to really work. I always had money. What things are you not reliable in? What do you mean children? Ok, Im pretty confused as to what you mean, but that sounds like a lot. I see. Well good luck with that, I wouldn't know because I don't have kids yet. Well, Im going through some drama right now with my sister in law, she hates me. "
"yeah, i think i will! who do you ask? aren't teacher salaries decided by some sort of... thing, or whatever? i love my family. how would the principal feel about you going behind his back? i'm a garbage man, although i'm a woman. my boss drives the truck, but i'm more qualified, really. dogs would for sure love a big truck full of garbage. i thik i'm the top 20 or so best garbage men in the area no.literally anyone could do it. you just pick up garbage. it's not as easy as teaching, im sure, buts ittakes no skill"
"The vehicle was exactly what I wanted, a newer model sports car. A Mustang GT, convertible A few years ago I helped with a restoration on a 67. It was absolutely gorgeous."
"Tap is pretty odd compared to the others. My daughter loves ballet. Yea, well keep it up, maybe one day you'll be on broadway. hahah that's funny. I believe in you though, you can overcome that.  No I haven't, I don't watch movies very often. Im usually out at clubs people watching. Probably not for a while. I just bought a new jaguar and I try to get out and just drive around and show it off as much as possible.  Haha the car not the animal. A jaguar would eat me as I tried to feed it for sure."
"You worked for a circus? Tell me you juggled while riding a unicycle and had a monkey on your shoulder. Me neither, but that might be because I like to drink...a lot.  Are you famous? I'm kind of famous in my own town. My favorite singer is Meatloaf, are you a fan of his? Not only is Meatloaf a great singer, but it's also a delicious food. Can't beat that combo. And meatloaf is the express train to my heart. Nothing like a little hamburg and spices to get things going."
I think I am going to get a new camera. Nothing but I want an upgrade. I am trying to do professional photography. You know just a flip phone haha. Are you working on a book right now? Oh! Interesting! That would be scary. Of course! That would make my career!
"It was. I don't know why I didn't just stop doing it. Neither am I. I'm not even sure why I brought up such a thing in a random conversation.  Amen to that. Anyway, do you like to read? Is that the animated movie? Oh thats really cool. Yea I love those movies a lot! Whats your favorite food? I love pizza, its definitely my favorite of all time. Chinese is great too though. Have you had chinese pizza before?"
"that is okay, everyone is different no i do not get what you mean, care to elaborate?  i think the crystals i dabble with can change your sub personality  im addicted to the power of them you will stop when you get diabetes meditation will dissolve all addictions "
"I do. I love watching football with my dog. Do you have any pets? I'm a student, which is great for now. Gives me time to hang out with my friends. What do you do? That sounds awesome! Nah. Never had the discipline. I'd always rather be with my friends. What did you study in college? Currently political science, but I'm thinking about switching."
"Yea, I have a really bad feeling that its going to crash or something.  Ok well, I had a vision last night that aliens would attack my plane and we would crash. No why would you be on my flight a couple weeks from now? They are from another planet, most likely Jupiter. Would you? I think that is for the best. It's safer. I think so, what Im not sure about though is if they every give them back to you. I think they might just mail them to you I am going to Japan actually but then Im flying right back. I'm really just going for the flying experience."
"No, I am worried about the calorie intake, haha. I can agree with that. Have you heard the news recently? There is new footage of an alien ship plying over the ocean. I always knew they watched over us. Yes it is shocking to watch. Tell me! I am always interested in UFO stories."
"I have two dogs. One named Bruno and the other named Mars, because I like Bruno Mars, lol. Aww, I'm sorry about your dog. What was your dog's name? That's awesome! I love Robert Frost's books. You must like to read, yes? Great to hear. I hope to read your works someday! have you been published in anything yet? That's good. I used to write some things when I was in school, but nothing serious. Always dreamed of getting a book published, though. Maybe one day I'll start again. I work too much right now and don't have a whole lot of time to devote to it."
I like country too! I was raised on a farm myself Sounds like good memories My hair was so red back then  its alright as long it is bright red I like the color of yellow reminds me of corn on the farm
What kind of positives do you get out of that? That's pretty neat. It must be hard to take care of curly hair.  I have had a dog that had curly hair. It was a mixed poodle and it was red. Really active animal she was.  That mix of dog breeds sounds cool. Was she tall like the greyhound or short like the poodle? You get all kinds of unique traits  Beautiful type of dog. We had one growing up as a kid. Hard to keep him contained I feel you. Cats are sometimes easier to have around. We have four of them now haha.

"It hurts badly so I am afraid I may have to see a doctor. Oh that is a good idea, I will be taking your advice. but what if that does not work? In today's world no one will take pity on me. The pain is excruciating. I think I need pain killers too I am so sorry to hear that you are in the same boat as me. We really need insurance. Well My mate proposed to me yesterday, I am so happy Thanks a lot. we would like to have five children."
"It sounds like good exercise Yes, i play a lot. Probably too much. I like RPG. Something to make me feel less lonely. Exactly! The games today are amazing! Same here, sometimes I play mario kart. It really has. The CEO seems like a good person."
"that is more than enough size for a hole, i should pay that course a visit do you work? no i do not have much time to fish at lakes because i am busy at the large law firm i work at what are you jealous of? you should try to get a job in law then ahh it sounds like you are really attached to your cabin "

They sound very fancy. I don't think I've ever owned a pair of blue shoes. I used to live in a blue house. But it got destroyed by a tornado. Yeah, I'm going to use the insurance money to take a trip around the world."

"Nice, we have a lot in common. I love rap music and fast cars. Hell yea. What else are you into? Nioce, what kind of stuff do you eat now? What kind of training do you do? weights?

"I only have one sister, so I didn't grow up watching much sports. Do you play soccer a lot? I wish I could join a soccer team. I'm to busy filling prescriptions all the time. Soccer players provide my sister and I with plenty of entertainment, so thank you too! She was ten when I started medical school, so that would make her sixteen now.

I like soccer and long tennis and cooking at home. baking most and BBQ in sunshine is lots of fun you know its easy open clothes in front of BBQ with cooking smell."
"That is pretty to take in all once can you explain Interesting, but some actions are more meaningful, like I am a vegan mainly because I wanted to change the world and save animals Because I looked in a cows eyes and they were the same color brown as my own Well it felt like I was looking into the mirror of my own soul and emotions That is why they mainly eat grass and things because they are just like me"

That's true.  There aren't a lot of dog facilities at the beach unfortunately.  I've got a small Beagle.  They are special. Untouched by human progress.  You prefer the ones that have been sanitized for human consumption? That was very good of you.  I can't say the same. I enjoy the feeling of being away from humanity.   Fair enough.

I need stop worrying about it and get back to my project I am working on a battle bot robot so I can enter a competition through my school  Cars are very coold as well however robots are much cheaper to work with at my age.  Maybe when I get older i'll restore a mustang. yeah you never know what the world will be like in 10 years! It just depends on how complex you want to get.  We have some basic bots that can cause a lot of damage with not much programming involved.
It's been a difficult time lately.  Lost my cat six months ago.
What would she have to do that was so unpleasant?  I am in between jobs right now. I pretty much hang out at home playing games and listening to music. Pop is cool.

"To become a lawyer Oh wow good for him! Yea its very difficult, I went to law school but then never got a job so I went into accounting. What do you do? Ah, sounds very lucrative though. Do you have hobbies? Haha aww, that's a shame. You have to have hobbies! Is there anything you wish you had more time to do? Well I hope you get a chance to. I love animals as well. Do you have a dog? I have a yorkie, he is a handful. But I do love him. Why dont you get one?"
"No, I am too busy with my ten year old son. Yes I don't talk to many friends from high school. Yes but I am generally quiet. Yes it is smart to be like that. That is probably wise. I am far away, it would require a lot of planning."
"Wow cool, I would love to go to that! Oh I love Mexican food! Horseback riding is definitely my passion. My boys love it too!"
"Spot on. I wonder why i bother anymore haha I dont know if they get fed up with all the advice. Like, sorry I care about you?  True there need to be a balance.  Pretty much, I am from Algeria and we're big on that. Gotta bring your own life in order first.  Yea and you feel like you're pressurizing them that away. And feel bad afterwards/  Yea as a last resort kind of thing. Pay them back later to show I appreciate them. "
"Great to meet a fellow nurse. Do you ride horses as well? You mean a talking horse that can teach you how to ride? I wish my horse talked to me. I encourage my horse to talk to me after I drink a lot of Budweiser but he never listens. Exactly, the hard part is staying sober when your fridge is stocked with nothing but Budweiser. Other brands are way too bitter. Yeah, i don't think i'll ever betray Budweiser."
"you are very knowledgeable, do you prefer nsync or bsb? haha kids of this days don't know them, i'm 46 and i still enjoying them, my kids only listen k-pop italian?haha that's strange, i only talk english and a little spanish "
What do you want Dang. I'm the complete opposite i just want to die happy I think so I guess so. I like being free in my daily life thats fun. I like making people laugh
who is your favorite snowboarder? I like him too but I have never seen him in completition just reality shows that he has appeared on.  Is he really good? i would imagine that you have to be pretty talented to be able to be a fringe athlete and become a household name. does he have other siblings who are also professional ? that is always a good idea to keep family out of the limelight if they arent into that type of thing i think i'll stick to my horses instead of hitting the slopes.
"I read about the sit ins in school.  I think boycotts are very important now. Now that we have the internet and social media, we can spread the word much faster. Very true.  I'd love to get involved in local politics are try to make changes personally.  The big issue is gerrymandering and getting big money out of politics.  If our votes mean nothing, we can't affect change. Yes.  At my work with a friend.  You? President wasn't up for the last election.  I voted for the house and senate with my conscience.  "
"So do I, I read a lot of stories about stuff like that and they make me so mad. Why do you think reading made you bald? Oh i see. You must not like reading as much as I do. I read every day. Oh that's cool! My parents, who have been married for 40 years, watch Jimmy Fallon every night. Yeah I really enjoying watching him. Has he written any books that you know of? I got it. Any other late night hosts you enjoy?"
"Sometime it is scary as I love forest and live near one in rural area. Yeah living in such places make you lazy and more food eater I'm a consultant and work mostly remotely with companies, how about u Man you guys make food ads so interesting to make people think about food all the time. Well living in forest and work remote and thinking about food is not making me healthy anymore I do really need some change I imagine"
"Well people love to pretend to be super heros by watching such movies Mostly I like Batman and I remember when my parents use to take and my brother  to see these movies when I was little And because he's more human than other Super heros That is nice how old are you parents? Lucky you living with them good for you, enjoy spending the time with them as much as you can"
"that's great I usually spend my time skating or skiing during here in colorado Me too, especially during the winter months. It's just so beautiful. Oh yea, is that a good time to go camping? I've been camping out there a few times myself but I'm usually to scared of running into a wild animal to go anymore."
"I think those who refrain from that are vegans, not vegetarians. I'm sorry you struggle. Why not just be you and not label yourself? I hear you, but I say love what you love eating. My favorite food is pasta btw. I love the multicolored ones! Makes me feel like a child again! I love chicken alfredo too! Do you have a favorite dessert?! Weirdly, I like cheesecake but not the bottom bit. I give that bit to my husband!"
"I live in Texas. Yes I agree. The best part however is that I live in an area where I can ride my bicycle to work. It's pretty good, but I don't have to spend money on gas. My daily driver is a bicycle that I pedal with my hands. I used to ride a subway. It was too noisy for me so I would always listen to music (u2, my favorite band). I'm torn and can't just pick one favorite song. What is your favorite band or song? Well, what else are you interested in?"
"i do not like star wars, was just hating on it last night to a friend about disney now owning them anyways, how is that turking life working for you? i hear you, i rather be doing this though just because if the perks of not having to conform i got fired from my last job for saying ""good luck getting through the VA system"" Well, kinda but not really, outsourced to them, me being a disabled vet, the irony thank you its getting better though, my life post army has been a real circus,. just enjoying life now"
"why won't it matter then? oh, that sounds highly unpleasant! is there any medication you can take for that or you just have to avoid it completely? i love music. my favorite genres are hip hop, jazz, and classic rock. how about you? my cousin is obsessed with him but i personally haven't listened to much of his stuff yet i like wu-tang clan, action bronson, led zeppelin, jimi hendrix, and a bunch more the first two make silly videos"
"Its when you achieve this state of blissful flow after pushing your body to its limit on a run.  Yes its difficult to achieve. very few people are able to do so. Maybe, I can't say for sure. I have experienced something like it before but not often enough. Only when I get free time from my editing job haha. Could be a physiological or biological phenomenon. we still have much to learn about it.  One, I am moving out soon to have more space for my wife and him. "
"I haven't either, but would be totally open to donating.  I do to. If you can help, you should, that's what I think. What kind of music do you like? I like pretty much everything, except for country. That's really nice of you to volunteer!  That's so funny that you would say that, I have long blonde hair too, down to my knees!! I couldn't agree more! But I can't ever imagine cutting it."
"Nature is magical the way she works. I think we're a bit like plants too. Because we need water, air and the sun like plants do. Plants are my thing. Love them. Do you have any plants? An orange plant sounds beautiful! Orange juice is cool too. Do you like it smooth or with bits? Agreed! I prefer it with bits too! Do you have any pets? Oh wow! I love turtles! I'm scared of dogs though (childhood fear). I have a lizard."
"Wow, for how long? Congratulations! How'd you do it? That's so sweet; much more technologically advanced than we used to do it, haha I do, although I have to admit I don't know nearly as much about them as you do. I've dabbled. Used an app learn. I just don't think my brain works like that, unfortunately  I'm sure they world. They'd probably be safer. What programming languages do you know?"
"Pavlov was fascinating. classical conditioning sticks even when you don't remember it happening. I have ADHD, so my memory is either spectacular or terrible depending on the moment.   Spicy!  I love something with heat.  You? I'm southern.  Discovered a my inner foodie in college really.  It was a bit of a surprise.  That's good too!  a well done meatball is excellent.  I hear the secret is to cook them in the sauce. I hear that.  I need to try to cook them at some time.  "
how did i miss that beautiful part of the city so you like traveling? any other hobbies? i don't go around that much because of work i'm a babysitter pretty natural
"I don't know, maybe they find it inconvenient, but it's worth it.  That's awesome! I'm hoping the future generations will realize the importance. I also like to grow my own vegetables. I'm thinking about trying to grow strawberries in the spring. I could use them in pies. I love to bake pies, it's probably my number one hobby. Apple pie is my specialty, but I also like key lime. Do you bake? It's great with a big scoop of vanilla ice cream, especially when it's right out of the oven!"
headphones headsets because they're louder my dad had a heartattack so i'm visiting ga from florida wow sounds beautiful oh wow my girlfriend loves to cook with fresh veggies i kind of like it. sometimes i would prefer fast food
"That's really cool, have you been a fan of basketball for a long time? Oh how exciting! Do they enjoy it much? You guys must watch games together I'm guessing. Oh how fun. I don't, I'm a little too focused on my musical career right now to have any.  Oh yes, I love playing the violin. I've been working on it for a long time. Do you enjoy music? Wow that's fun, I would love to learn guitar. I have been playing violin since I was 10 years old, so more than a decade! I think I'm okay but I still need more years before I'm fantastic, haha. Have you played guitar for long?"
I read it about it. I am an art teacher. I see art all the time I love it .It is my passion.What do you do for a living?? Just make sure you try and eat more healthier foods also Not as much as I would want it. My problems is that I eat to much Italian But it also has lot's of carbs
"You can pickle fruit??? I don't think I'd like pickled fruit very much - YUCK!  Do you have a favorite food? Well, I definitely have a least favorite food - sweet potatoes - I cannot eat them in any way. No, I just cannot stand the taste of them at all.  Love pumpkin, regular potatoes, but not these. I love love love to lift weights! What about you? Oh I bet that is a lot of fun!  Do you do it for a living?"
"I'm a pretty big fan of Black Flag and Misfits too. What about you, what other bands do you like? That's cool, have you ever had the opportunity to see any of your favorite artists play live? Oh that must have been pretty fun! I've been lucky enough to have seen Black Flag quite a while ago, it was great. Do you play any instruments yourself? Wow, you're quite multi-talented there. How come you no longer play them anymore? Aw I'm sorry to hear that, I hope one day you're able to pick them up again in some way. So what do you do for work? That's a good attitude to have. That sounds like an interesting job, do you enjoy it? I work nights outside a punk rock club, I watch the door for them."
"Scrapbooking can be so time consuming though. It is a lot of work. I'm sure she would have appreciated that option! I'm not really into scrapbooking, but I do sew clothes for myself and other people. What is your favorite book in that series? I've heard of those books but I've never read them. I love Universal! I'm a big fan of theme park rides. I really like the Hippogriff ride. It is actually in The Wizarding World of Harry Potter."

"
"Sounds interesting. Do you have one at your house? That was nice. I should look into getting one for my wife My wife and I like to go out to dinner. What about you? Yeah, we can't do a lot because of my wife being deaf. Makes it difficult It can be sometimes. But she's wonderful and I wouldn't change a thing"

I stormed out and haven't talked to them since It's horrible. He does it all the time and my parents don't care Yeah and he's the youngest. Always been the favorite. Do you have any siblings? I have in the past and they just tell me to get over it. I can't even imagine having 5 siblings Oh that doesn't seem too bad. I'm just waiting until I'm 18 and then I'm going to move out and cut them out of my life Yeah I can see that. It's just going to take some time to heal. Do you get along with your parents?
"Oh yes, I remember seeing that in a documentary.  Very interesting. I like Pizza better personally.  We have some really good pizza here.   I'll do that.  Working at Mcdonalds you get so sick of the food.  Never work at a place where you like the food. Definitely.  I'll never work at a pizza shop or an ice cream parlor.  I like them too much Ooh, I've never been to Argentina. When did you go?"
"Lebron is from Ohio. He won a championship there...but he wanted to go to LA for movies and stuff. I was watching the show 911 and it reminded me of a time I had to use them. Yeah, I had a headache...turned out just to be a bad migraine. I watch a lot of sports and news. I do thanks for asking. I hope you can read this as I'm using speech to text...I never wrote in school! Thanks...they never really taught us...everything was watching videos and typing on machines."
I put on stilletos It made me taller and I put on a lot of makeup church of satan i play blackjack there yeah we gamble there a lot we dont care about laws honestly
Nice! kids are great. Do you shoot? I lead a gun club and we target practice a lot. That sounds interesting. How long have you been a digital artist? Nice. So you're a natural! Any plans for the weekend? I'm going golfing with my friends! I can imagine. If I spend long periods without my friends I go crazy as well haha. That must have been tough on you. How long ago did you move? Sorry. Hopefully you will make a lot of new friends in Canada.
"It did, but it felt like forever. Pepperoni, with mozzarella and pineapple.   So pizza is perfect for you, red sauce, pepperoni, red peppers... Most things actually.  Especially indian.  Have you tried Vindaloo?  It's delicious and red. Rice, potatoes and meat with a spicy tomato curry I'm not that good.  Indian is very complicated to get right.  I can recommend a good restaurant in several cities. "
"Spicy wings? Must be nice, I love eating them  I mostly go for mild otherwise because thats about all I can handle! Pizza with wings is a match made in heaven. Love them on game day.  Not really, never liked the taste of it. Whats your favorite beer? Haha everything is better when your team in winning. Even cold pizza.  Just thats its Friday tomorrow and weekend shenanigans are ever closer. What about you? "
"I could but sometimes I feel like no one will love me because of my size so I stay. Even if my beer gut is so big I can't see my feet? That's so sweet. I bet your in a good relationship! Do you know any good ones where I live, in San Francisco?  How did you meet your partner?  How fun! Were you guys from the same place?"
"Still can't place it.  My memory for names is terrible.  Songs and people.   It's so embarrassing.  I don't know the name of half my office and it's been to long to ask... I get around it.  Just smile and chat and never mention names A little, but I know all my labmates so I can manage the other people.   That would be nice.  Sadly the lab is very hands on.   No mice.  Cancer cells.  They deserve it."
"So is exercise...I really should do more...like walking or jogging. I work 12 hours a day 5 days a week and I'm so tired!! Yeah, I love Pink Floyd! You can help me with mine! Then we can chill and listen to Dark Side of the Moon haha. I need some music suggestions for a workout playlist...like some fast metal or something to get me hyped. Yeah I have a bunch of Pantera records! I like Mastodon a lot too to get pumped. Cool...although I'm so stressed from work I might need to limit the aggro music lol."
Yeah so grateful that there are still honest people out there That's great! What do you do for a living? I am enjoying my retirement. It's nice to have freedom. How do you like working at the bank? I hope you are able to find something you enjoy. 50 years working in the factory was tough. Amazing how much better I feel now Honestly? I never had time to find love so I've been going on a lot of dates. Older women know what they like
"I work with bulls. How interesting, I am a vegetarian for that reason! Well I started working with bulls in Spain as a baby- that's where I was born and my dad worked with bulls and they were vegetarians so my whole life. I dated a bull fighter for a few years so I used to run in that circle.  I really enjoy drinking coffee and people watching. How about you? Oh I love the guitar! Do you play acoustic or electric?"
"I told her I ate my broccoli when I really fed it to the dog! So I've been told. I still don't feel right eating miniature trees, though. i did not know that. that's fascinating. cabbage is kind of gross too, though. I would consider trying some stir fried cabbage, but it'd have to be done by a competent cook. I'm no good at cooking! I would love to learn but I just never have the time. What's your favorite dish to cook?"
Writing is fun Well just start writing Yes I have written a book Fiction book about money no it's about how money will not be a thing in the future there won't be currency
No. But they served some amazing wine! It was pricey and delicious! Yeah I met a few there. Do you like animals? I have a french bulldog. She is a handful but I love her so much. her name is Sasha. You should get one. They're nice companions. About 6 years now. She is getting up there in age haha. I so am. Where are you from?
"I'm a cop so I have to find some way to release my stress. I hunt...it can be both relaxing and exhilarating. I don't drink and hunt though! Yes and in my line of work I need to be of sound mind and body. Nah...big furry mustaches are a necessity for any real officer lol. Lots of people think we are following them...but I can't tell you if we really are...then they run! I hope you're doing well dealing with your issues, ever want to take a hunting trip let me know! It's a good time."
"I don't understand why it's so difficult for people to pick up after their dogs. This is why I'm a cat person. I'd rather just scoop out of a box! lol I bet they can. Hey, if anyone could do it, I bet you can. Since you're smart enough to clean up after your pup :)"
"What sorts of dishes have you tried to cook before? Some sure are easier than others! That sounds delicious! I personally really like cooking italian foods, they're really rich and not the healthiest but so tasty Spaghetti, oh boy I could probably eat 5 pounds of it in one sitting. Yum. Have you ever been to Italy? Oh you'll have so much fun when you start travelling. Where in the States do you live? Florida seems lovely, I've never been but it always looks so warm. Have you lived there your whole life? Of course, it's difficult trying to move away from your loved ones, and it can be hard to find support like family. What do you do for work?"
"Awe no, it's about hamburgers! I eat meat only and love watching movies about them! I don't pay attention to ratings, I just know it's my favorite movie! Burgers are always yummy! Me too! What's your favorite place to get a burger? I love bacon as well! Yummy! I just like the meat, I'm not into the veggies."
"He's okay now, he managed to pull through after a bit but it was sure scary at first, it's hard seeing a parent like that For sure, it's a big life changer. Do you still have both your parents? Oh my that's really rough. So you know what it's like then. How long have you known your fiance for? That sounds nice, I personally have been to many weddings and sometimes the simpler ones are the best. When are you having the wedding? Oh how lovely! Niagara Falls is great, I've been there before. That wedding is coming up fast, are you excited? I'm so very sorry to hear that. Do you think he'll be able to walk you down the aisle still? "
12 yeah i just want the lil dweeb out of my house! so annoying! can't wait til shes 18 and i'm back to living no way. no cars for her yeah she should buy her own I defintely agree with that
Kelly. She's so great. Do you have a girlfriend? We met outside a bar when she told me she liked my car. What's your wife's name? We both love watching sports and traveling. What do you and your wife like doing? Alison is a nice name That sounds like you guys have a good life. I bet you're excited to have the house to yourselves
"yeah, it makes me feel great inside when i finish a run yeah, you're probably better off using an exercise bike or something anyway because you can do it inside and it doesn't put so much stress on your joints i don't watch a lot of new movies, but i did just recently watch the newer blade runner movie and really enjoyed it it's the right season to be watching horror movies. i haven't gotten to watch any yet this month yeah, i used to watch the older ones when i was little. i loved jason vs. freddy too i also like the freddy movies but they used to give me nightmares"
"I wish I could bring him. Maybe I should say he is a comfort dog. I'm just a stocker. Not full size pianos, no. But we do have keyboards that you can learn on! Wow, really? What inspired the buzzcut? Makes sense. I'm leaving for college in three months, so I'm thinking about a new look. Fordham University in New York! I'm planning to study finance. Gotta make some money!"
"what would cause you to move around? impatient or some other type of issue yea a lot of people never get diagnosed for whatever reason.  its never too late to go and get checked. im scared of spiders and now that summer is over and its going to get cooler, they will start coming out no matter where you go, you can never get away from them.  i just found a black widow hiding in my travel trailer jack last weekend yeah we feed our bearded dragons dubia roaches.. we have a colony of them! they are nice until you have to clean up their mess.  it stinks. but they are nice to look at when they are going after their food."
"i used to love pink when i was in high school! do you like her newer stuff? i do some drawing on a digital tablet but I'm definitely an amateur that's arguably a more important talent to have! i'm a mediocre cook but i'm always learning new things and trying new recipes i love italian too and i'd probably have to go with that. i'm also greek though and i do love greek food a lot of olives and feta cheese, and yogurt. mediterranean food in general is all pretty much the same."
"Yeah, he's a really great guy. Do you have any pets? two cats and one dog. They are a handful but i love them. Kind of. I will go for a run every day and I come home to find the dog hiding and the cats look suspicious though lol. The cats 5 years and the dog is only 1 year old. Thanks. I live in America. Where do you live? I bet it's nice there. I live by the Gulf coast."
"i think yoga is a great way to improve your entire life! oh, me too. i have one and i do like to read on it but nothing replaces the feel of a book in my hands. i also love being able to have a library. i think books look so nice lined up together i love the smell of a nice used book. it gets me in the mood for reading oh, well that's no good. i guess it's not true what they say: ""any pizza is good pizza"""
"would you have a bunch of your own horses there? i have only ridden a few special occassions i like to walk my dog around different places and play video games. how about you? our dog is a mutt that we found on the street, so we don't really know her breed we named our dog bowie because she has two different color eyes, like david bowie yeah, we have a parrot and a cat too! how about you?"
"Oh definitely. Do you like playing games? I do, I haven't had a chance to play in a long time though. Thanks and no not yet but I hope to get a pet soon. Is your cat nice or sort of solitary?' Oh that's too bad but maybe the right cat could fit in with him some how. I am from the west coast, how about you? I like it over here a lot, it's beautiful. I love the coast in the gulf, though as well, the sunsets are so gorgeous."
"Well, I enjoy eating junk food like candy and soda with my friends while watching a good game1 Don't we all!  What do you like to do for fun?   Thats a lot of dogs!  No pets over here.  My wife and kids are allergic!  I love dogs though. I have 2 little girls.  They are crazy!  How about you? 9 months and 4 years.  I love them, but they are a handful!   No.  Kids are expensive and I don't want to work forever.  I don't think my wife wants to get pregnant again either!"
"That's really weird.  I'd like to try playing that while singing. I could get into that.  I used to play guitar but now I just do karaoke on the weekends. It's cool, I only do it after I've been drinking though, ha! I don't know if I could sing sober either.  I just have to be careful to avoid hard cider since I'm allergic to apples. Yeah, me neither, I'm a weirdo.  That's probably why I still eat them even though I'm allergic! Now that would really be a problem!  At least apples are easy to avoid on a daily basis."
Do you like beans in your tacos? same here. i also don't like spaghetti. You're luck! i just graduated high school so i don't get to go eat out as much. what kind of flavors do you sell? Nice! i would like to try sometime maybe. I like all sorts of music. classic rock is one of them. 
That is so interesting. How long did they rule?  That's okay. My parents are from Japan so they tell me a lot of things about emperors and what not. It's so interesting.  When I was 10. About 20 years ago. Honestly my favorite thing about living here is mcdonalds fries lol. Those are good as well. What's your favorite type of food? I understand. I have to workout a lot to make sure those fries don't make me gain weight. I like to read and paint. What do you do for fun?
"Oh yeah they are sweet. I love Collies.  Oh cool, what's their name? Yeah passports are tough, I haven't ever travelled out of the country myself. Oh haha oh man I was confused there, but wow that's a fun unique name! It's a good one, do they have a nick name? Oh that's kinda cute though. "
"Yes I know she really likes vegan bean dip for one thing.  No it's just a diet choice for no reason, although I suspect it helps to lose weight. Yeah, it's kind of crazy. Do you eat any special diet yourself? Oh cool, do you know of some tasty indulgent vegetarian recipes? Oh that's nice of her! It must be pretty cozy. Yeah you must be very appreciative of that."
Yeah that's right. Have you ever done it before? I save about 10% more now that I do it It's coupons. I cut them out of the mailing flyers Mainly the flyers that come in the mail but I do print some out on websites also. Just depends on how much time I have I try to mainly buy things when they are on sale. Especially if you can get them buy one get one free I always buy whatever cereal or chips are BOGO. What about you?
Do you run competitively. I'm in the sports information business.  That's my kind of running. I do it so I can have cheesecake and hot wings.  Those are both good choices.  I like plain old cheesecake and pretty much any of them with real fruit on top. 
I've only traveled within America. But I've been to so many beautiful state parks. I love nature.  Yellowstone or Tennessee state park was my favorite. If you come to America definitely go there. How do you like living there? I've always wanted to visit there. I don't really mind cold weather.  Awesome. I can do some shopping. Especially if I find blue dresses. Anything blue is pretty much my weakness. Haha that's funny. And I actually love cheesecakes. True that. Those people cannot be trusted.
"That doesn't sound exciting, I am retired though so all I do is watch movies. Great, what do you volunteer for by the way? Good for you. Where do you live? I live in central Louisiana, pretty boring here. Sometimes, just the to the French neighborhood. Why do you like it? It reminds me of the old western movies, the building are so old there."
"At least you can get a job, nobody wants to hire me with my condition. Doctors said I have Autism, although Im just quiet that's all. Well it's hared to find a good paying job where you don't interact with anyone anyway. So I'll just live of the benefits. Yes, traveling is fun, it's like a new religion these days. And you? That would be nice. What's your job by the way? Well that makes sense. Where did you fly most recently? "
"Oh makes sense. But anyway what other hobbies do you have? That could be fun, I just do morning runs 6 days a week. You should try it, running give you a lot of energy. It's like dancing. What makes you think this way? With flowers? Or do you use them for tea? That's smart, but do they look nice?"
"I like nature anyway so I don't mind getting a used car. Yeah, that way I can travel through rugged terrain. Do you like animals? Yes, I even enjoy looking at wildlife. Yes, I have a dog and a cat."
"I like pizza.  Do you own a car? Are they automatic or stick? I love use stick shift on cars, my dad taught me when I was just a kid.  Yes. Especially sculpture. And you? I like Da Vinci because he is so precise and inventive."
"I love pineapple on pizza!  That sounds good too! My cat always bugs me for the toppings.  Same here. They are chaotic but lovable!  Mine will paw at my feet and crawl all over!  I work with metal, helping construction projects! You?   Thank you! What are you going to school for?"
"Sorry to hear that. I live near a beach, so there are lots of touristy pizza places in walking distance. It honestly gets old getting sand in the book spines lol. I usually just sit by a window to enjoy the view when I read. That's a really good idea, I should look into one of those! Any particular one you like to use? Is your model waterproof or do you just sit away from the water? I'd be worried about ocean spray messing it up. I don't know if there is either lol, just curious if you knew of one that is. Haha sounds like it! I'll split the earnings with you lol"
"What else do you like to do with your free time? REally. What do you do? I work at a movie theater, mainly because I love watching movies."
"It's a chest that's used as a cooler you just put ice in it. Do you have any hobbies? Are you the only child in your family? Than you hobbie makes sense, I have 4 sibling, so I have many hobbies. I do, or do you mean like big trucks? What exactly?"
Oh I can do way better than Red Lobster! Grilled shrimp on a charcoal grill glazed with garlic butter is amazing. I wish I could get fresh shrimp but I'm afraid of wide open areas like the ocean I do too - I really need to try! Well that sounds like a plan
"Never met them? Have you tried to reach out to them? I have two younger brothers, I'm the oldest. I don't see them too much these days. I'm very busy with work and school, plus they are reaching their adolescence. They want to spread their wings and venture off more.  Yes the second oldest is ten years younger than me. Pretty normal, like any other family I suppose. Do you think your family is normal?"
"Oh I'm sorry. Which limb? Wow, that's interesting, very good og you to stay positive Where do you work now by the way?  Well I work on the opposite side haha. I work at an old museum of technology. It's museum that displays history of technological progress, like from button phones to touchscreens.  No, it unique and fun, or it could be the first few times."
"are you into music? I think so - it's been awhile since I've listened to them as well - I like to read books now I love Harlan Coben actually, but also really into Lincoln and Child Yeah not much into them as I used to be. I agree - music soothes the savage beast so they say I agree - today's music is junk for the most part - and with horrible language"
Really? Where do you work this days?
"Thank you!  It was hard but now I can finally get my feet moving forward. Thank you!  That's what I'm hoping for, more free time to work on the things I want to do. Exactly!  School was great and all, but knowing I had that time to myself to work on my passions was so great. That's very kind of you.  Music, art, theatre, those are huge passions of mine.  What about yourself? I love Enya, she has some wonderful relaxing music.  Definitely my kind of music! I'll listen to her or music like that in general, soft music like that is great no matter your mood."
i have a son he keeps me busy yes its really hard sometimes  yes I love to make crafts hbu yes we have so much fun. Do u want kida? thats great they are great fun me to its been good talking to u
I try to but I do schedule breaks so I don't burn out. What do you do for exercise? Oh that's cool. What does your dad do? Oh that is good exercise. Do you have a job too then? Oh you don't like science? I love it. I majored in Zoology Yeah it's the study of animals. The school I went to split biology into plants and animals I've always just liked it and found it easy. And I love animals. I always thought English classes were the hardest
"I like the digital artists more, like the ones that make video games.  Do you paint with oil?  Are you good or just leaning?  What is the painting about?  I really would like to see it. "
"I think I'd like to have a grocery store that sells only pizza! Well, maybe, but I'd prefer if it was cooked first, I never understood the point of buying uncooked pizza. Well I think the main color in my restaurant should be red, that's a really nice color. Well my true favorite color is red but I think that might only be because it is part of purple Yeah, purple is a very elegant color.  I'm used to elegance since I'm a spoiled only child. Well, let me describe red for you... it is like a passionate kiss with the knowledge you will never have that feeling again."
"I am good as well.  I have not seen that movie. I listen to a lot of music.  Recently I have been listening to older Bob Dylan.  What about you? What else do you like to do for fun? I am not much of a gamer.  I prefer to get outside and go for a hike. I would love to go to Scotland.  So much to see.  Do you travel? That sounds great.  Do you enjoy touring, or is it good to get off the road?"
"setting goals and completing them Thanks its just the beginning, i  am already setting my next goals. i look at it like a marathon and not a sprint.  I try to lose at least 2 pounds a week "
Is time really an issue for getting tatoos? And how long is a session? I've thought about getting a tatoo but the needle scares me haha saying 1000 needles isn't very assuring lol I've been playing a lot of golf lately It's nice and relaxing. But starting out it's a bit frustrating not being able to hit the ball
yes i love to keep to look back at memories. Absolutely I have parties to look back on too oh my gosh so do I I am not sure probably new years  yes halloween is the best too no not really
"Well i love rollercoasters because of the physics involved Do you like feeling outside yourself? All the trees and flowers, nature can be so perfect Theres a lot in nature that can be used for science. Do you like to read? My friends think I am a nerd for reading so much, but i find it relaxing. What have you watched recently? I really enjoyed it, the last season got weird though."
I like mystery flavored desserts and cakes. How about you? What is your favorite thing to ear? Sounds tasty. I like junk food like fried chicken and hamburger  I have watched many videos of korean fried chicken on Youtube. It looks great! I wish I could eat more Asian food but I live in the middle of nowhere! Do you live in a multicultural city?
"No, because it wouldn't be safe for her. Why do they have so many locations? So she won't need inflatables?"
"I don't know yet, I haven't tried it yet.  Do you like it? That sounds good.  I am looking forward to it.  What else do you like to eat? What breed is your dog? I have a Poodle.  It is big too.  Do you have a yard? I own a home with a smaller yard.  How many trains do you own? That is a lot.  Good thing for the big yard"
"Ok, you seem so sure. Do you have experience with this stuff?"
"Spaghetti is okay, but I don't know why it's the go to pasta dish. There are way better ones. That makes sense. Probably easier to package dried pasta too since we don't make it fresh. I'd like to visit spaghetti and try the real thing. Not, like, whatever I make that's just dried noodles and nasty premade sauce lol Oh wow. I wonder why? Well, I'd take a well made pasta dish in place of money if I were in...that line of work. So it fits well enough As a woman I can verify we love good cooking lol"
"yes that is wonderful to hear. really you are blessed i understood what you exactly meant. they are helping when you are in need. so i said that you are blessed with wonderful family. yes, i have got a wonderful supportive family where we share our problems and solve within us. yes, thanks. Are you living in a joint family or separate ?"
"I can always help myself, that's very important, then I can help others after helping myself. That depends on the person.  Some people help others more than they help themselves and some people don't help others at all. Oh I didn't mean it with the hope of getting something in return.  Just that you can help for the sake of helping to all sorts of degrees. And you have no regrets about doing that?  Like potentially rereading those books someday? That's very generous of you, I'm definitely not that kind.  I do love animals though, maybe I should volunteer. That's great!  All kinds of animals or specific ones?"
"Oh I see. Do you ever have thoughts about switching jobs? Well, I'd recommend talking to your employer and maybe see if you can get a raise. If not, try searching for other jobs. Yes! The more money the better. Good luck with that! That is true. I value my free time as well, but hey, what harm can more money do. Right? Haha! Awesome response. Well It was nice talking to you! Likewise!"
Did you have any damage to your house? how many dogs do you have?
"yeah ive actually had the opportunity to catch up on some episodes, as i recently starting working online from home."
"Wow, they've lived long lives! I've bet they've got a lot of stories to tell Lol nothing wrong with being short. It came in handy for me while growing up on a farm Perhaps, although I noticed the beards were in with the hipsters when I moved across the country at 18. It was quite funny lol And a whole array of products! It's like makeup, but for beards. They seem to work nicely, though. That's so sweet! I almost got my boyfriend one of those, but since he loves incense, I got him one of those cool fountain incense things. I'll have to do my research. And you should definitely get one! The holidays are coming up so maybe you can ask for one as a gift!"
"Yeah australia is amazing in its own way, very nature based country! Truly! I was of thinking of diversity and complexity when I made that decision, glad I finally got my mind to agree on something! You should go to Melbourne, they held UFC 243 there, last weekend! Thats true! I love seeing there growth over time and how they have grown as a company with names such as conor mcgregor! No he's not, Khabib Nurmagomedov holds that spot.  No he's not, the current champion is Khabib Nurmagomedov do you still watch ufc to this day?"
"I love cats.  I black black cats especially. Me too.  If it wasn't for pets life would sure be lonely. i have a wife and kids but let me tell you a secret between us, I think I like these cats even more! Yeah my cat had a kidney stone or something last week.  We got her antibiotics but I think she passed the stone because she had blood in her urine. is that really true?  I think they help with the blood pressure, but yeah I have anxiety. I haven't seen a doctor for years.  My wife takes the kids in but I feel healthier without one."
"It's a mexican restuarant with the best tacos I didn't at first, but moving here there's only mexican food, so you get used to it never tried dominican food. what's it like? Oooo. I love spicy food.  I'll def have to check it out.  love indian food, curry, naan, etc"
"I did not know that.  Are you a dancer? What type of music do you play? I don't know much about what is hard to play. I like all music including opera music. I used to play piano. I have, do you like his music?"
Me too! I am gonna bring a portable CD player  so we can watch Scooby Doo - best show ever! We can do both .. I am not really used to nature - my job is as a doorperson at a punkrock club Drinks sound very good. In my job I can't drink whilst working but after the club closes I always have a Bloody Mary.  It's vodka with tomato juice and a dash of tabasco. Lovely stuff.  You will love it. You must come to the club I work for one time! My fiance pops in sometimes but as I am working I obviously can't talk to him on the job 
"That's pretty cool, I should read up on more of that! Reading usually is!  Any other sports you're into besides basketball?"
"I agree I must've not like them, plus the pigs were hungry You think a murderer cares if something is disgusting? I think that good and evil are subjective and ultimately human constructions that don't exist what books do you recommend? i'm familiar with think and grow rich. great book"
"Nice, working on a farm seems fun.  Yes! Farms are outdoors, so it is as natural as it can get. Same here. What is your favorite? Beaches, farms, or the urban life? I see I see. What type of farm is it? Like what type of animals do you have there? Oh wow nice. That farm seems pretty legitimate! Sounds great. My grandfather actually owns his own farm with horses and chickens in it. I love going there!"
"I was just kidding about stealing, but money is kind of tight right now. I'm watching a horror movie right now - I love being scared. It's The Ring - have you ever seen it?  I haven't seen it in years. Man is this creepy! You are right - shouldn't watch so close to bedtime. Do you play any instruments? I've started back with playing violin. Played as a kid, then didn't for many years. Now trying to get back into it."
"what do you do for a living? yeah, i've done that. not now, though, i freelance so i work from home. eh, somewhat. i'm not super social though. i'd rather stay home and be online. are you a big social media person? i think so. i usually just scan twitter and look for funny stuff. i follow lots of people, celebrities mostly i probably have more ""friends"" online than irl. i don't really do well in face-to-face situations. that's true, especially for dating. much easier to sort through online profiles than try to talk to people at a bar or whatever"
"I didn't say anything, just walked away. Yeah, I felt really bad. I don't understand why somebody would that to another person. I mean I know I am a little strange but I didn't deserve it. It has been nice talking to you. It is making me feel better. Yeah that would be great. How are things with you? We should go together sometime. I can try to be your wingman."
"I'm not sure. Maybe it's the weather No it's quite hot still actually haha. but i will be moving soon to a colder climate No not really, just for work Well I don't want to leave my nice island life haha Well when i'm out at sea fishing it's nothing but wide open space Yes, I love it. Fish tuna"
"I am! I was so nervous to go to the dentist, do they make you nervous? You are very correct on that one.  But it is a necessary evil.  Did you enjoy your day today? That's good that you found some ""you"" time.  I like to do crazy things to my appearance when I get in a mood. Of metal music?  I see.  Do you play too? Im sure you would do great at it if you tried.  What instrument interest you?"
"Yeah. Miami is full of them! Most certainly! I agree, I have no idea how some people passed their driving test! Well, that's life for ya! haha I agree. From the speeders to the rude people. In the neighborhood roads?! That is so dangerous on their part! Oh my. I feel for that though, Florida is full of them!"
"mmmm. I'm also a fan of their ice cream, if the machine is every working haha That's good, what's your budget? Nice, you should check out this app called YNAB. love it"
"Haha, she's probably buried in a grave What struck you as sad? Do you think there is beauty in the sadness of her poetry? Perhaps she wouldn't be famous then, if her predicament were different Not really, wbu? I tried picking up digital drawing, but i quit after being so bad"
I did not know that.  Do you like animals? I love animals.  Especially my dog. German Shepard.  Do you have any pets? A zebra would be an awesome pet. Do you have a family? Maybe a zebra for the wedding
I really want to move out though. She doesn't want me to. By being around me? LOL you're hilarious. I know! I have a good sense of humor. My dad does too. I miss him a lot. I bet that's incredible. Where do you like to travel? I wish my mom would let me go. I'd even join you. Who do you usually travel with?
"Are you a fan of pecan pie?   Yes, it's my favorite!  I always make a lot of pecan pie around thanksgiving since my family loves it so much! Not so much a good cook, but baking is definitely my forte.  I'm not sure why, I've just always excelled more with baking. I really do!  It's a huge passion of mine!  I didn't know you were considering that, that's amazing! That's gonna be a huge leap of faith.  Are you sure you're ready for it? I've done a little bit of managerial work, but nothing like starting my own.  That is something I want to do someday though."
"Well I just lost my job, so I think maybe I really am looking for a cheap flat!  Ha! Well thanks for the offer but I'm too proud to accept, I'll be okay, thanks though! Well I might consider it actually.  I like to stay up all hours of the night but I just ordered some headphones so that might not bother you... HA!  I went sober for a month last May, and it really helped me out, by teaching me to appreciate my beers even more, which I'm doing right now!!! I think we can get along marvelously!  As long as you don't mind me being a redhead that is! My gal!  We will be the most fantastic of roommates!"
"That's quite interesting. So they have functioning plumbing and kitchens too? Fascinating. I wonder how the reception is. I eat out more than three times a week, so I'd love to be able to order something while out on the water Oooh, I've only fished once. I'd love to learn how to do it properly. I'll make a plan to do that. I actually look down on people who don't eat out as often as I do, but I'm thinking I need to reevaluate that. I grew up eating out a lot and was taught that being domestic is out of fashion. I may have missed out on some serious life lessons and skills lol Do you have any suggestions?"
"I am a pharmacy graduate,so i am in that field Oh,that is nice to know,what will be your daily routine  Its really new dimension for me about sears,because sears means always clothing and shoes only comes to my mind,Last year they closed so many showrooms right Now i am doing a part time job,because i have some restrictions to take full time work Hobbies  right now only sometimes painting what kind of music western or classical or jazz,do you know to play any instrument"
"Hi! How are you doing today? I just got back from my trip to Colorado.  Oh it was beautiful, I'll have to go back sometime soon. The next place on my list is Utah. What have you been up to? New Mexico is also great! You can always find the best salsa there. I love traveling and trying new foods, especially pies.  Totally! Mexico seems fun, maybe Canada as well. There are so many places I want to see before my time is up in this life.  Oh that would be beautiful, the only bad thing about that is how long the air plane ride would be!  Unless you're on a cruise ship, then it becomes more fun. "
"What kind of salary you thinking of? Not bad, are you married or have a family? That's good. Will you both work in the same city? So when are you gonna put a ring on it? No need to impress when two people are in love. But do put yourself in a stable financial situation. Yes I own several as an investor actually"
"yes, i have heard about them. they are really awesome. i also would like to play games often oh ok.. do you like dogs? how about your other activities in day today life oh so good. do you grew up dogs at your home ?  did not get what you say oh ok i love to feed dogs and make them so happy. they are the ones who never hurt us and gives only happiness yes, they are true stress busters. "
"Well that's super cool. Have you ever seen an Armadillo in person before? Oh cool! You live in Texas. It must be very hot there still. Oh wow. I don't think I would want to do that. I would need to bring a lot of water Cold water is much better than warm water, that's for sure Nothing better I like to do arts and crafts and I also enjoy taking long walks."
"You know what else makes me move? Music. Pretty much everything. I hate country and jazz though. What about you? I think it's just the lack of excitement. It always reminds me of elevator music. I like stuff that gets me pumped up. I can understand that. Only time I like loud music is when I'm hitting the gym. Pretty much every day. I am a verifiable gym rat! Haha.. what about you? Hey, that's just as good. I can't really play racquetball at home though, which is my favorite thing to do at the gym."
"I could, it's just going to be a pain to have to ship it back and wait for it all.  Still better than wasting my money I guess. That's a good suggestion, but what I want the headphones for doesn't support that sadly. It's to plug into an electronic I have that doesn't support bluetooth, it's just a regular stereo plug. I'll definitely have to give it a try.  Do you have any headphone recommendations? I'll have to look at them and do a bit of research then, thank you for the suggestion! I sure hope so too, finding headphones that don't crap out on you and that aren't insanely expensive is tough."
"What's up! How have you been recently?  Aw I'm sorry to hear that, my cousin had to wear braces for 3 years and she hated it. What's weird is that her twin didn't need any. Well, there has only been one set of twins in my family, and I'm hoping when I have children it will just be one kid at a time.  Oh for sure! If I had twin boys I would probably name one Lex and the other Clark, my love of Superman will never die lol Same! He was my favorite superhero as a kid. He's still my favorite today, but Batman is a close second.  Oh for sure. The Dark Knight movies were my favorite, but the Tim Burton Batman movies will always have a special place in my heart. "
"I spend my free time fishing and camping and such, I don't buy much clothes other than outdoor stuff I used to buy them at specialty sporting good stores but now I just use the internet I'm casually seeing someone. Not sure if it'll go anywhere. You Do you enjoy that? I am a general manager at a casino I do! It can be very interesting sometimes. "
Yes I wonder what causes people to become like that? It alienates so many people from them. My Grandmother was like this and would get anxious whenever someone would move her stuff. Oh she would collect new things. Even go through stuff people put on the side of the road. Me too. It's such a rush when you cut all those coupons. Almost feels like real money! Do you have kids? I imagine someone would save a lot of money couponing with kids. Haha. Me neither. I keep a little folder of them when I go to the store. Cashiers probably look at me like I'm crazy.
"She always loved to try to steal food off my plate. Once, on my birthday, she managed to snag a whole steak for herself. It was pretty funny, actually. She always treated it like a game, and she definitely won that night. I miss her so much... What kind of dog do you have?"
"I have 2 dogs and a cat. My cat always gets on my tv when I play halo 3. Labs are great dogs. Mine are golden retreivers. That sounds like a cool job. I hope to be a video game developer one day. I like to think so. So do you have any other pets? Yeah, dogs are happier when they have a furry friend. I bet! I'm not a lawyer but books overrun my house too."
what song is your favorite do you like hip hop? do you like country? how old are you? where are you from? where do you work?
"Do you ever want to have kids someday? How many do you want to have? and you can ask me questions too  I think 2 is a perfect number. And if I have kids I will make sure to make them barbeque sandwiches and pizza puffs Yes, it's like pizza on a roll, but not like hot pockets because the pizza part is on top of the bread rather than inside. What is your favorite food? Well I like Mint Chocolate chip myself, but I am also fond of coffee ice cream. Do you enjoy coffee? Oh tea is good. And good for you! I also take some when I'm feeling ill I understand that. It was pretty hot here but now it's getting cooler. I love the fall weather Where do you live? I have always wanted to visit Hawaii! maybe some day I will. It was very nice chatting with you"
"Well I am not sure. My boyfriend is actually in the army so is away a lot  Alas not for the next few years but hopefully one day.  Yes. I am looking for a present for him right now - a tee shirt. I want it to be yellow as that is my favourite colour.  well, erm, yes, good point.  Yes, I think about him a great deal even though he is so far away.  Oh I tell him very regularly but it would be nice to do so face to face. "
"Oh my, that is a long time! I heard they used to put cocaine in it before, too. Hahah! Yeah that can definitely be a reason why. No way! LOL.  Yeah I was going to say, you may have anger issues lol. As long as you are trying, though! Oh my gosh! Hahaha!  Well, I'd have to say water. Plain and basic water!"
"Under the couch. I'm always misplacing things. I am! Sometimes we drink too much and fall asleep on the couch, haha. How is your day going? Good to hear! I'm just chilling. I work at a bar on the weekends, so making the most of my day off. That sounds pretty full on, do you enjoy it? That's cool, busy is good. Do you have any fun hobbies? Haha, Reddit is the best. I spent too much time on there. Do you have a channel on Youtube? or helping someone else create content?"
"Sure, let's hang out at my apartment this weekend, and I'll teach you Oh yeah, I've heard that psychology homework can get pretty lengthy and tough. I'm not the biggest fan, but my dad loves it. I sit and watch it with him while eating our favorite food, jello. Oohh I've been looking for new things to make with jello. Will you teach me to make them? I love those! It's my favorite thing to have at parties! Lol same! It's a staple of college life lol"
"Me too, and I love visiting other countries and trying new foods there. I would never survive as a vegan! I love cheese too much, and so do my cats. I have no desire to be though. I love food too much, especially cheese. No, I am not interested in that either. Have you considered it? Let me know how that goes! what would you eat? Good luck with that! Meanwhile, I will travel the country with my cat, eating meat!"
"How exactly did you celebrate it? Sure, I got surprised. Did not expect anyone remember my birthday You got it right. Poverty makes us forget about birthdays and parties. family members and few relatives. They managed to come from oversees The Kingdom of Dreamland. Have you heard of it? It is in some sense"
"I do work out some. Running mostly.  I have a programming job for a small technology company. Business applications. But I love video games and play in my spare time. I turn 40 tomorrow. No I'm hating it. I'm still in pretty good shape though. I eat pretty well and don't drink any alcohol. No, I quit when I turned 30. I smoke some weed now and then though."
I am diet Vegan diet I just trying to be healthy How about you? That's great! I am not fully vegan
"I hope so. I think they're going to the same place next year. I just need to discipline myself, focus on my work, and stop going to so many darn concerts! I love them. I go to at least 10 a year, sometimes more. I absolutely LOVE Madonna. I've seen her at least a dozen times, but I think more. I love them too! Why do you like them so much? That's amazing! I am part of LGBTQ+ so I love that."
"I like to blend into the background personally .. I want to look cultured and sophisticated though.  I have a problem with self esteem as I came from a broken home.  No. I have a problem with my step dad but he ignored me all the time.  I have not tried therapy - it is expensive.  I could give it a try but it is difficult. What about you, do you have a good relationship with your family?  It must be wonderful to feel that!"
"Yes thank you. It should definitely be a goal to stay in great shape! Slimming? How so? Oh I see. Well hey if it's working then good for you! Lol. Eating foods you don't like haha! They are called fruits & veggies! Yes! Broccoli is amazing, although I always forget how to spell it. Same here! With one C haha"
"Awesome.  Kyoto would be a great place to visit. That would be great!  Where would you like to meet for lunch? Ok...Let's plan on it then.  We can catch up on everything else that is positive in our lives. I know, it's been way too long since we've enjoyed lunch together.  When are you leaving on your trip? Got cha!  How long do you plan on being gone? Yeah, you'll need a few months.  I know when I went to Cairo, Egypt, I stayed for three months.  "
"I am not sure, but I heard it over my loud pop music. I live mostly in Canada, but sometimes in NY. You? What kind of music do you like? What is your favorite? Pop music would be top of my list. Because it is my favorite."
"I know, I do feel very guilty about it. But there's a basketball game starting I want to watch.  Maybe after the game. And then I need to go work out  Do you not work out? I do so every day I love the gym .. I also love swimming and jogging.  What  did you need a break from?  I am very sorry about that  - my dog is elderly and I dread her passing. "
"Mummies were a big fad in England historically. I personally don't see the point in preserving corpses but I think the practices are neat! That's true! Sometimes I wonder how much we misunderstand their intentions, though. It is! Makes me wonder how incomprehensible an alien civilization would be since we have so much trouble understanding the past of our own. I wonder what will happen if we do. That would be ideal. I don't see the need for conflict."
good. how is life going? how many kids you have ? one children. he is studying high school. i am a happy house wife oh is it. hunting what ? wow great... do you hunt at the forest area ? i am house wife. will be going out for vacation with family. that is the only entertainment for me. any forest areas. we would like to go all over the world trip
"That is so sweet. Do your kids play any sports? Mine plays soccer, which is my favorite. He's the goalkeeper, and a good one at that! They've only played a few games this year and they've lost 1 game, won 2. They're an elementary school team. The Jackrabbits. I'm not comfortable sharing the school. Thank you! So do you have any siblings? I have a brother who used to be in the navy. How many?"
"I haven't tried it yet but I'm going to try it since I'm having trouble finding a real job. I definitely will! Other than that, my social life has been better than I expected it to be lately I think it's been due to me getting out looking for jobs. I've met a lot of interesting people. It really does. So how have things been going for you lately? I know that feeling. My former boss was a pain too. Always micromanaging. Exactly! I plan on doing that one day"
"I've been there multiple times. Any other places? Honestly I would prefer Europe. Have you ever been in Japan? Maybe we can go together. When do you expect to be available? That's fantastic. Here is a deal: I pay for the airfare, you pay for the hotel.  Do we need visas to cross the border? OK, that's very important. Also do not forget to renew your passport. Very well. This trip should help to my brother to stay alone and think about his life. He has been having a lot of problems lately. Our parents were not able to help."

It's sooo green (my favorite color) and the people there are wonderful. Plus the architecture is unparalleled. It's not terribly hard. I had to go through some schooling for it and then on the job training, but it was worth it. What do you do? You have a lot of time to figure it out. Animals are always drawn to me. I'd love a dog but I'm gone all the time. That's true. I try to go to major zoos when I'm in a new city but I don't always have time. That would be fun! I've never been there before.

"Of course. Going to the gym is one thing I find interesting to do. I noticed I was looking frail after I lost my parent so I started using the gym to look active.  Sure. Maybe you need a little push, not necessarily a sad event like mine. Even the slightest compliment about how fit you are looking is a motivation already.  I find joy in little things such as a compliment I have a trainer. Having him smile at me at the gym is something I look forward to. He inspires me."
"Yeah I got a warranty but it's so annoying, do you drive a car? Aww that sounds lovely, do you listen to music with them? Like Justin Bieber? Cool, I'm listening to Olivia Newton-John right now!

"It is a symbol for LGBT pride, but I am not sure how it came to be or what it represents for certain people There might be here too, but I have to admit I don't follow personally. Only what I see on the news Unfortunately, the movement still has a long way to go. The small mindedness of some people is so upsetting. I think people get in a certain mindset and are just too stubborn to try and see that they might be wrong. We are all stubborn in some sense How funny that you said that. My son literally came out to me 3 days ago. He had been scared of what I would say. I trust in my religion, and I love my kid. I only feel for the rough path he might have ahead due to other people. I cant protect him forever."

Ibelieve teachers should be paid so much more than theyare sorry just got carried away.  I do that sometimes You should look into being a professor.  It pays more It is a lot better than a public school teacher.  They make nothing The teachers do that all the time but it doesn't seem to help. The government does care. Very true my child is in a private christian school.  Public schools don't teach them anything
"I've watched some foreign cartoons Some, but also lots of Italian cartoons. Some of them. I bootleg a lot. A lot of older films and shows are in the public domain The mindset of the public domain is that the art is old enough its fallen out of copyright - usually several decades after the death of the creator.  The Internet Archive is a great resource. It catalogs a lot of things from the library of congress."

"Oh wow...who have you heard most recently that you like? I like Techno music but I also like Classic Rock like ZZ Top and that sort. Oh gosh...all of them...Van Halen, AC/DC, Aerosmith (although they weren't considered really rock back then) and of course ZZTop.  Really?  You ever think of selling it on Ebay?  That's probably best because then you would definitely miss them. I live in the country so I just turn it up and hope the dogs don't mind the noise...they don't :)"

"My son is in dance and he gets bored with the strict repetition of moves.  Learned what specifically?  How to Moonwalk?  I tried and failed miserably after watching a video on how to do it.  Oh how fun, we're so lucky we live in an age where Youtube and such exist.   Oh I love to shop online, the magic of the being able to buy anything and everything with just a few clicks is amazing.  I love Goodwill, you can find such awesome bargains.  I like to shop at local thrift stores too, they have some hidden gems.  I really should pay more attention to being environmentally friendly.  "

"Oh, wow! Yeah, that makes sense.  Usually long pants. I'm a night owl, so usually it's colder out when I go somewhere. Yeah, also depends on the time of year. For sure. Wearing shorts in the winter would be cold! Sometimes, I like all the seasons, but mostly warm."

"That's true, and I really don't care. I just want to find a good job. I hope so. I have two kids and my husband can't work. Do you have kids? Oh that sounds difficult. Are you a CPA? That's great! I wish I was better at math. Finding admin work is hard with everyone else looking too. I'd love to be a teacher, but going back to school for a new degree just isn't possible right now. That's a good idea! Do they need special training?"
"I love the Beastie Boys, I listen to them while I train for wrestling.  Me too, although I hate admitting that I'm old enough for that though.  I know, but the play them on the ""classic rock"" channel, which makes me cringe.   That's true, I try to exercise and maintain the physique I had in high school.  Oh that's interesting, I bet you learn all kinds of neat stuff being a museum curator.  Well I hope it goes well for you, it's important to continue learning all throughout life. "

"Sure am! Plus so I got a girlfriend last month so I have to keep her safe too Thanks are hurricanes an issue where you are? That's good. I'm a biker and you can't ride when it's stormy especially hurricanes so I really don't like them. My cousin in WA state got snow 2 mornings ago, luckily it probably wont snow here for a couple months Oh wow, I'm ready for hurricanes but not snow! Yes, exactly! I can leave whenever I want in rain just might regret it but it's an option"
"No, but I bet she was mad when she did realize! I don't go into town often as I run the family farm. Next weekend for sure. You ever done that? I run my family's farm. It's a dairy farm and takes up a lot of time. What do you do now? Well, there's never a dull moment, for sure. And in some weathers I think I'd prefer to be in a factory, lol. I'm up at four am, seven days a week. You get used to it. That's probably why I forgot to tip the waitress - exhausted! Hopefully. What type of factory do you work in?"
"It was a little more realistic, but they did give free chocolate to me and my boys. They really loved it. Yes they really did. We plan to go again. Eating all the chocolate of course!

I like more organic scenes. Lots of trees and greenscapes. Of course. It's my job, but it's also my therapy. It can be hard sometimes. Money is hit or miss, but I wouldn't have it any other way. For sure. Some months are better than others that's for sure."
"Beautiful! Sweet, I make clothing and bedding too. yeah, Thank you so much I have some dresses to make. Do you have kids? Yes, they are very much adorable.  Stylish , I have never tried making fitness clothing, I will try it someday."
"I know my trade just enough, the side deals to export the good are the most demanding now days. Hot all the time but me I personally lilke crochet.

Aw I love Florida. Basically anywhere I can scuba dive really. Denver is beautiful. Do you ski? Yeah guess it gets harder on the joints as you get older. That's why my wife and I love scuba. It's not very physically demanding. That's fun too. You should give it a shot sometime you are in Florida. It can be if you want to own your own stuff. But you can always rent and it's not too bad. Yes I would definitely recommend it.

Wow, I'm impressed!! What is your book about? No, I haven't. Is he a nutritionist? Are you? That's so exciting.

It seems like a neat place to be. What are some of your hobbies? I love playing sports, especially soccer. I also like to hang out with friends and go to the beach. I like laying on the sand and feeling the sun on me."
"It did. That always takes so long. No, just new paperwork because I switched doctors. Guess it is better than being at home and having to clean up after my husband and children. I hate that! Exactly! As I was waiting to be called back at my appointment I caught an interesting TV episode on aliens. Do you believe in aliens? I believe in aliens, too. Interesting subject for sure! I have! What about you? True. And, the universe we live in is pretty big and I am certain these things are out there!"

"It was. I brought some pita bread with me to much on too. I love pita bread! I love to have hummus with my pita bread also. You like hummus? Sometimes. It depends on what mood I'm in being bipolar in all. Luckily the meds are helping with that. Yeah, it does. I think I finally found the right combo of meds to take to help it though. I do like taking in nature though. Thanks. I really appreciate that a lot.  Yeah, I have a pet cat that I love a lot that helps with that. I also enjoy reading too. That's my way of meditating my mind I guess."

I'm not good, but I enjoy it."
"I am from Indiana. I don't like standing in the rain but sometimes get stuck in the rain when walking the dogs. I know, you told me previously. I am a librarian, do you enjoy the library? I do understand that it gets harder to read the more busy you are. What is your occupation? That is a respectable career. I believe teachers need to be paid way more than what they currently do. The starting salary around here is about 35K/year which is not nearly enough for what some of them put up with. How long have you been teaching?"
Yea but she told me the wrong items so now I have to go back out again. she wanted different stuff. U know how kids r. boy do I know it. How many do u have/? Nice I do too thats nice I hope she has a good birthday. R u having a party for her? wow thats gonna be a busy day I hope she loves it
"I prefer Dr. pepper. We call it soda in the country. You say soda or pop? That's neat. The only time I collect cans is if I need them to get a discount at the state fair. I have a blue Subaru myself. I love the color blue. I guess it would be hard to find a purple toyota. I like to drive to the city near me sometimes. The car? Yep, but you have to be sure they do a good job or it'll end up peeling and fading. Yuck. That's funny because my 2 favorite colors are red and blue, so that makes purple. Cool."
"she has an implant and shes great with flowers no she does not, she's an inspiration I'm an engineer, how about you? mechanical engineer, so have you got a job yet just from college thats interesting, enjoy yourself when you start working there won't be a lot of time for that oh yes, but will be going on holiday soon with the family"

My twin brother is a Best Buy employee and brings home used games sometimes. We are Canadian and hope to move to the US soon.  Do you enjoy it? I imagine it quiet and open spaces like Canada is. You should work at Best Buy like our brothers. Maybe you will enjoy it. What about moving here to Canada. Lots of jobs and thriving cities! We have a small circle of close friends. No family left here. They're in Italy.
"I work at a music store. Yeah it's great to get free music and listen to it all day. Jay-Z, J. Cole, Travis Scott are a few. Yeah at ACL. He's amazing. Some electronica and Jazz. Grew up listening to Jazz with my Dad. Yes. I still have several of his."
thats one of the first places im going with my friend from college
"That's true. I actually work for a railroad. So that is kind of up my alley. They can be loud and annoying to live near. LOL true. The work is hard, but at least it pays well. Well good luck! Conductors can take a while to work up to, but definitely pay well once you do. That's neat. I do enjoy some good rock. For sure. England is rich with music history."
"That sounds great. I like that no animals are ever killed. I I volunteer at a local animal shelter. Dogs and cats mostly, but anything that comes along we try to help. We had an injured skunk once! I think if you treat them right they wont spray you, just like a well looked after dog doesnt bite. What do you like other than animals? I like most sports, but football is my favourite. Do you grow vegetables in your garden or is it just flowers? That must be very satisfying, I am not green fingered at all! Are there any sports you like? Yeah, I support my team beause of my older brother.  Which team is nearest to you?"
"Oh wow, I'd love to see that show. I bet it was fantastic. Did you like the live action Lion King movie? I actually haven't seen it yet. Me either, I've heard it's not as wonderful as everyone thought it would be. Very true! I can't get past the real-looking animals talking. I did like Aladdin, though. Will Smith as the genie was actually funny. Not sure he could top Robin Williams, but still good. I just saw it recently! I wasn't expecting much but I liked it."
"Exactly! It's way better to just be genuine Really I think it's always best to be that way, don't you? What, so you just fake your personality now? I'm just working today, then I need to go grocery shopping  I don't really. I usually end up buying a bunch of random stuff haha Whatever looks good really. I can't resist new meat substitute products."
"I think I travel a lot to to keep my mind occupied, I'm a bit of a nomad. Yeah, you don't get into a rut when you're always moving. I'm actually in Japan at the moment. I look forward to the day when I travel...knowing I have new experiences ahead of me. Yeah I hear you, that's why I had to take this journey. I had many mornings at home that I had trouble getting started. That's why I have been travelling, it makes every day memorable...like I'm going to see Mt. Fuji today! Japan is pretty peaceful, I hope someday soon you can come here and get a break from what you're dealing with."
"Yes we finally made it after a few wrong turns haha I met quite a few interesting people in my youth aswell, i was quite the wild child"
I wonder what it would be like being the other gender? I agree! Do you date or are you married to anybody? Aww that's so sweet. I hope to find that someday but I'm never sure if I'm attracted to anybody or not. Wow that was so deep! Are you a philosipher? Because you have some deep thoughts going on! What's up for the weekend then?
"Most definitely, I like that type of rap too, more old school then new school. Yeah, speaking of that, you watched straight outta compton? Yeah, it was a fantastic documentary, another one I might suggest is The Defiant Ones, its on HBO, 4 parts, you really have to watch it, if you haven't already.. its to do with Jimmy Iovine, how he started and recruted Dr. Dre, how Dr. Dre recruited Eminem, and how they founded Beats and so on. REALLY nice. Uhh, I love nature documentaries too, I love animals in general, so, Planet Earth, Blue Planet and so on, narrated by Sir David Attenborough, those are fantastic.  Yeah, really gives a perspective to the whole world that we live in. Do you have any recommendations?"
"Yeah. But I also had a chance to do a little gardening, so that was nice.  It really is. It really helps take my mind off of other things and de-stress.  I eat out more than I would like. Touring with the band makes fast food a necessity. But I still find time to volunteer.  Metal Gear is our name. It isn't much, but it's a good living. I'm sorry you work so much. That has to be rough.  I bet it is. Basketball seems fun. I don't play myself though.  I do not. I do not play many video games. I mostly spend my free time gardening or volunteering with the humane society. "
That's interesting. I've been needing a little faith. I've been so lonely recently. Yeah. My mom is an artist and is sort of a recluse. So I'm neither well-socialized nor religious
"I really like being a vegetarian. I dont like hurting animals. I have read alot of books on being a vegetarian. I have bought so many used books. I have been one for over 5 years now. Have you ever been one? It just takes time to learn how to drive one. You should try again.  I think you will do really well, if you try. I enjoyed talking to you Have a great day and go read a book."
"I have long red hair. I think that they do, I am really not sure.  Red is one of my favorite colors. I have a red scooter, that I like to ride, that is red.  That is exactly what my scooter is.  Yes, that it is. I really like all different kinds of places.  That is good. Cats like tuna I have one kitty. She is a pain, but I like her."
"two weeks, i have to prepare and get the house in order for thier arrival yes, cleaning the house and making sleeping arrangement. awesome that sounds like a great idea me and my family can do when they get here.  who doesn't love the beach...the smell of the ocean, the clashing of the waves and the nice breeze is always soothing. cool i bet you have a extension collection of beautiful shells back at home....i would like to see them sometime yeah that sounds great..i didnt know you was funny like that. its always good to have a laugh and a drink"
"Nice, I paint for a living, although it's not much at the moment. Yeah, I think yoga and art both help you get in touch with your inner self. I feel bad as my family doesn't know what I do. They think I'm in law school still! This is what I want to do but law is what they want me to do. I'm lying to them until I figure out how to tell the truth. Yeah I hate lying to them but they would be so upset right now. Maybe you can teach me yoga so I can relax more! If you want a mural on your studio walls or some nice paintings let me know. I work cheap lol."
"My happiness right now all has to do if weather or not I hear my neighbors yelling in the middle of the night. Almost and I'm in a townhouse so we share a wall and you can hear them through the wall My husband has and that started an fight between them Yeah, its only an issue when we are trying to watch tv. Once we go to our rooms you can't hear them anymore Everything. They have been quiet the last couple nights I wonder if one of them left. Yes, I hope so make my life a lot quieter. What brings you happiness"
I wonder if the armor serves any other purposes.
"I'm a junior. What are you studying? Cool. I'm studying accounting. What's your favorite class this semester? I'm taking an astronomy class right now. I love watching the night sky. I really love Mars. The starkness of the landscape is beautiful to me. Would love to see us set foot on it one day. I haven't - need to check it out. As an artist, which do you appreciate more - simplicity or complexity? Hah! I gravitate toward the extremes of each side. Especially in music."
"Yes I do, it is video games. I like to play them and want to become a streamer some day. I like to play all kinds but I mostly like to play FPS and TBS. Ah, that is very cool. Kindergarten was my favorite grade in school. How long have you been teaching? What is the most important thing you have learned since you started? That is very interesting, have you considered teaching other grades or are you focused on Kindergarten age only? Understandable. I believe teachers deserve much higher salary due to how important they are to our society and our children."
I do love guitar. I actually offer classical lessons. I just enjoy listening. I LOVE classical music. Well at least that is a good use of your time! Oh yeah i bet. Love me some sweets. So does everyone else apparently. That is good. Not enough people are involved or even care about politics. Gotta vote. Would you ever run for office?

"Yes. I spend every day at least fixing one thing. I really enjoy it. Thank you! What about you? Do you like fixing things to make things better in the world? That is great.

Yes, with this younger generation sales are starting to boom with a renewed interest in vinyl records. I have 3 cats, actually. I am also scared of the dark and so my cat is useful to me for that, as well."
I really like glasses. I like that you can pick so many different sytles.  I have glasses to wear.  I have to wear them for corrective vision. I would be blind without them.  It is one of my favorite. I like that kind. My favorite is fried dough. My granny use to make it for me.  It is the best. I used to enjoy helping her. 
"It can be time consuming. I lead a research department for a large restaurant chain, so my plate it full. Well I had my share of that when I was younger. I actually am in charge of french fries so smoking pot would be nice! No, we do mostly tacos. Del Taco. LOL understand. I miss being young that's for sure. Yeah age will sneak up on you. Enjoy it while you can. Yeah it is nice to surround yourself with people that care."
"Yeah it does  Really  No, I haven't been there  I will love to visit someday  Not really, I work too much as a medical assistant  Yeah, I play football. How about you "
"As far as I know, it's maintained by Facebook and other companies.  Bora Bora!!! what about you?"
"I've been wanting to see The Joker, but I'll have to see what else is playing before I decide. Yea, It looks interesting and the reviews seem to be great. Bummer you didn't get to go last weekend. What held you up? That sounds like so much fun! At least it was something worthwhile and enjoyable. I love sunsets. I don't. I used to when I lived in the country. Now I'm more of a beach bum. Oh for sure. The beach is my happy place, I could stay for hours and never get bored.  I haven't! I'm not sure I've ever heard of it, actually. What genre is it?"
"That is very interesting. I try to live off of the land as much as possible. I learned many agricultural skills from my parents. I believe so, there is much value in living a subsistence lifestyle.  Are you passionate about agriculture as a whole? That is very true. What is your favorite food? Red meat is very good. Do you enjoy smoked meat? Yes raw is not an ideal condition for it."
"LOL. I love donuts too, but I have to watch my weight. Swimming helps. I haven't tried weight, but maybe I will. Do you like to swim too? I love it. It's relaxing. And being in a pool really feels great when it's hot outside. Wow. I haven't tried swimming in an ocean before, but I be it's a lot of fun. And they come in so many beautiful colors. Have you done any deep sea diving? I would love to see a starfish up close. Really? Have you ever seen a purple starfish?  I love the color purple and I think starfish are awesome. LOL"
"I enjoy those bits... but I'm mostly into the culinary pieces.  I've published a few.  :P Usually, a recipe with some science behind it.  Like... how to temper eggs into a custard... and why they curdle if you don't temper them correctly. You could say that, lol.  I did train as a chef and love Spanish food. Recommendation?  It depends on you!  What do you like about food? What do you usually order at the restaurant?  Maybe I can help with some pointers to recreate that dish at home! Hahah.  I don't remember that episode.  I should though.  I own the box set.  I'm putting it on now.  I think it's on Netflix. I do meal-prep for personal clients. I tailor meals and nutrition plans for all types of clients."
Because I thought he would be excited I was bringing in more money.
"It's a 1979 Ford. It was actually given to me by my dad. It's pretty old. Thanks. It still runs well, but I try to take care of it. Do you have a vehicle you really love? That must be pretty reliable to drive in the snow. Gotta weigh my truck with sand, but there's not much snow in the South. I can understand that. It's tough to drive when gas prices are higher.  I just graduated high school in the Spring, and I spent my summer at the coast. It was great. I don't watch TV much. I help my dad with his business, and am trying to decide what to do with my life."
"They are awesome!  I have this great Red Hot Chilli Peppers T shirt, black, I am always wearing black! I love Under the Bridge, it reminds me of home, What about yours? I work as a computer technician, hate it!  If I didn't have my music, I wouldn't make it through the day That is so funny, What do you do for a living?"
"I like cosmetics made from natural ingredients. Mind you, the last time I went to the store for some there was a robbery and I was held hostage! Well, I kind of knew what to do as my Dad is a retired police officer, so I just didn't look at the guy and waited for the police. It really makes you look at people differently, for sure. Makeup's not THAT important, lol! I was for a while, but not now. The robber's in prison, and lightening never strikes the same place twice, right?! That would be pretty scary - at least with the robbery there were other people around. Do you have an alarm system? No, I live in a town home surrounded by other people, and with triple locks on the doors. This is a really quiet neighborhood though."
"My mother takes care of our pets and COOKS! Do you cook? Any favorite foods? Yes! People are not always nice either? I live in a tourist town. Are there many people near where you live? Yes! I live right by the Lake Worth Beach. Been here too long though. I miss mountain weather. Lots of jobs here but too much HUMIDITY. Do you get to the beach ever? Yes. I get to go to Tennessee at Christmas. Can't wait. Hope there's snow. Do you like snow? That would be a deal! Sand does get everywhere in the house though and doesn't melt, lol. Hope you have a mild winter where you live"
"I think it's very ok to be anxious and nervous. It's how we are made and build. But overcoming it is the main thing Well if it helps you to control your nervousness.  I love to eat vegetables, I drive so much nutrient from them. But I have a gambling problem It's really affecting my life. Because I gamble a lot. I'm already looking for ways to stop it. I've not looked into it. But I will,  thanks for recommending them It was nice sharing this with you and you helping me with a possible solution"
"It was hard, I need this job.  I am broke! Thats a cool industry, but it is so confusing to me. Bitcoin and Crypto are such odd names. HA!  If you do get in maybe you could get rich! Right now I am a janitor at Disney, people laugh, I hate words like trash, so I give it sassy names so its nicer I love that!  I am going to use it. I will come work for you but we must call the toilets SnapDragons ( sassy)"
"I have 2 sisters also, when it rains I actually like it a lot.  It rains a lot, I think it is about 45 inches per year. Does it rain a lot near you?  Nice, Do you ever put your dog in a van?  Nice, a friend of mine does that. He does pretty well. Stay away from highrises though Dog walkers have to maximize their time, so my friend prefers not to have to go up and down elevators./  Yeah, charge more then. We have a mix here in DC. "

"i love them too that is cool i love the morty wears too maybe three  me either. yea, but it is cool"
"I'm going to buy new decorations for Christmas - I just love decorating for the Holidays! That would be a good use for a bonus. Do you do a lot of gaming? I like messing around on the internet and learning how to do stuff, but I couldn't build one. That's a great hobby to have! I like to read, play golf and listen to classic radio programs. But perhaps I should start to learn how to build computers! Mainly legal dramas and biographies. I'm fascinated by other people's life experiences. Do you read much? Audio books are good.

I love shopping there, they carry Game of Thrones board games to books. Somewhat when my young siblings ask me to. I may get the Game of Thrones Monopoly game for novelty sake Absolutely. What's your favorite place to shop? I know Walmart carries everything so it's a one stop shop for me. Yeah, it's really all about convenience to a location. There are less Target locations near me as opposed to Walmart. Target stores have a nicer, cleaner and have less cramped isles in my opinion."

So many people have gluten issues I like to provide something for them. I sure do! Being from Scotland, I definitely have that in my repertoire. A chocolate whiskey cake, actually. I should bake you some chocolate whiskey cookies, lol. That would make your day fly by! Me too. All these cakes and pastries are for sale, so I don't eat them...at least, not during the day :) Too true. Thankfully for my wallet and my waist, there aren't often many leftovers to take home!"
"I like to grow flowers and fruit trees. Do you ever garden? I once had chickens. It was crazy around here. Have you ever seen a live chicken? Chickens are much noisier than I ever imagined.

"Yes, it is my favorite time to bust out some songs! I know, I just do it automatically. I would never do that with people around. Aw that is cute though. How many dogs do you have? No, though I probably should. I'm a shy person, they would be good company for me. Sounds like you love them a lot and they love you, except when you sing lol. No kids either. Just me, which is why I get to have the bathroom to myself."

"It was quite terrifying. I wonder if he recognized me from my controversial article published in the new yorker magazine. That seems even like a worse situation than mine. My article was a criticism on China's humanitarian violations. The article is especially relecent to their recent repression of the Uighurs. Do you have any phobias? Lol that is absolutely a real phobia, I know exactly what you mean. Job searching is the worst.  I do not blame you at all, the job market can be difficult to navigate but do not give up on your dream job! Absolutely, don't procrastinate and keep hustling until you get to where you want to be. Your future self will than you! "
yeah well i get that. lol it's tiny enough for me to put it on a truck and take it to another state for a ride.  you have a band?  wow you guys can come over at my tiny house.  We can party like those Bacardi advertisements. lol  you might have to set up your band on the roof though. lol  oh no! now that's a problem.  I can play drums in your place. not saying i'm good. lol  Get yourself a pair of ear plugs to be on safe side. 
Ah that makes sense. Not sure I could do it either. Ladybug. And you? Because they are beautiful and eat pesky mosquitos! In science class in school. I'm not sure. I just remembered that fact. Are you in the military? I'm studying to be a music teacher myself.

Do you have a motorcycle?
"Yeah, it's absolutely confusing to know what insurance covers these days.  You must be hitting those book pretty heavily this semester. I try to read as much as possible on my downtime. I used to be a brown belt but I was living on my own and had bills to pay, so I had to give it up and bartend instead. I'm more slim like Bruce Lee and they usually hire large framed guys as bouncers. I guess they visually make more of an impact. Actually, bouncers are given insurance to cover any such sustained injuries. I'm sure it depends on the club hiring though. Yeah, for sure. I wish you the best on your next performance."
"I love tacos. I live in Houston, Texas so great tacos are everywhere. What's your favorite taco? Ha, thats a classic. Even with lots of authentic options I still get down with Taco bell. Big fan of the crunchwrap supreme. That's fair. Do you like Chipotle? I used to eat there all the time then they had that food quality issue and it seemed like everyone abandoned them It's okay. I've moved on to better choices anyway. Do you like motorcycles? Yeah, I get that. Luckily I've never crashed mine but I know people who have. I always wear a helmet."

Plus you have that lovely cool weather this time of year. You live in a great place. Are there mountains there?"
"How do you know that? I had a one video game where the main character was a ballet dancer. That was funny. Do you enjoy the video games? You are like me. How much time do you spend on video games? That's a lot. What else do you do for fun? Ok, back to the subject we started with. What is the best color for my t-shirt? remeber, I have blonde hair Yes, but I need to get dressed properly first. Nobody likes unwell dressed people during the ballet concert"
I know! I have a terrible memory. That's not good. At least it waited til after your vacation! Strange. Maybe you've got some sort of intolerance. No thankfully. My daughter can't have any dairy. Yeah she has colitis. Dairy makes her have flare ups. Almond milk is our friend.
"I fell down a hill one day chasing my dog in the park. In three places. It was awful! Yes. And am now recovering with physical therapy. A few more months.

Yes, I love shrimp, and Salmon Haha!  Yes, you could sue him for damages! Yes a brother and 2 sisters, how about you? Awe, thats great, I am close to my sisters, my brother and I arent too close"
"I don't have a lot of money, I just live in a small apartment. I want to eventually. I want to be able to host my family for holiday parties. A yard and patio would be nice. It would be perfect for a summer barbecue. I live in the mid-Atlantic, somewhat near the Chesapeake. I am not familiar with that college. I went to Towson. I also have a large family. I have two sisters, a brother, two of them are married with kids, and we also have a lot of cousins."
"yeah, he was a family member for a very long time!  I used to knit him sweaters. He was a mutt, but we think he had some greyhound in him. Yes they do, and they also a good majority of the time, do not have the health issues purebreds have. Yeah, it is crazy how much pets cost.  I have another dog and he had jaw sugery Oh you do not even want to know... LOL  Definitely cut into my shopping budget! yeah, it's a HUGE commitment!  Maybe you can take up knitting like me... it's cheep and distracts you rather well."
"Interesting, but honestly, its not easy. yes, for sure.  I definately need to research to stay healthy. Great advice!  I am cautiously optimistic!!

I like how he makes me feel safe because I feel he is a workaholic and can address any problem night or day. Big culture war going on though. He certainly isn't being blackmailed or playing politics.  Wonder who will run in 5 years, when he finishes his term. Oh yes, he'll win and then after that 4 years, I wonder who will run. It will be hard to go back to insider politicians again. Yes, he's the Master ""Troller"" in chief! Everyone should laugh more. It's not like he'll be in forever like Putin and Xi. He's funny."
Not most of the time that is good and great  yes i am good Really it is good though Im working in a hotel has a manager
"Yea, It's ridiculous. I don't think it will be getting better anytime soon. I'm going to keep trucking on though! What do you do for work? Aww, thats so great! What a rewarding job. Teachers do not get enough respect, and are definitely underpaid in my opinion. What grade?  Teenagers require a different skill set entirely, I think. They can be a lot to handle. Not that grade schoolers aren't difficult at times. Its just different. I completely agree. Grade schoolers are so sweet, and innocent - AND HONEST. I went to visit my son one day and got so many comments about being bald.  Yep! Just absolutely no filter. It was all innocent though.  I do. I have a dog and a cat. "
What do you do for work? Yeah I can totally understand. What grade do you teach? Ooh that sounds rough I'm a teacher as well! Elementary PE. I played basketball in college so it led me here Yes it's a lot of fun actually
"I am a big fan of robotics, I wonder how long before robots become delivery drivers."
"I eat take out all the time, I try to tip well! It is scary how much they can seem like a human!  "
Not really. I need to be extreme in my emotions to really feel like I am alive and it helps. I sometimes write as part of my art with words on the canvas and such.  I enjoy it. What types of short stories do you write? Nice. And no I am self taught. Yes I have an online store and a gallery sells my work. Oh wow! That sounds like an amazing time.
"i was supposed to go to thailand but now i am stuck here at home oops, that was a typo. i had thailand on my mind at the time of writing it. i meant jamaica. excellent! tonight i am going to the opera. going to the opera is one of my hobbies. hopefully i don't bonk my head while exiting my car this time. six feet tall is seemingly too tall for my car. yeah sometimes it makes life difficult. my back is always very stiff yoga would probably be in our best interests"
"I love cleaning. I find it very therapeutic. How about you? besides driving, I do most of my thinking when I am cleaning! awesome! What kind of dance? I am so jealous. I took ballet classes for a few years but I quit. I miss it. Ballet is beautiful I used to take clogging lessons too. that was a trip lol"
I am vegan. I do not eat animal products at all. Yes. It is true. So what about you? Alright. It is true I am vegetarian. I was testing your knowledge.  Sometimes it is interesting to find out how person will behave when presented with a given situation. So are you vegan? So what you would call your diet? Yes. Your family did right by you. Excellent choices.
"that is true i have not join any no, how about you? yea puma it is cool, just for me"
good I think you are right about that.. Yes i do Yes i think Yes of course When are you going to be free?
"That's terrible!  I'm so sorry to hear that.  How has your recovery been? I bet that's hard as a farmer.  I'm just going to college to become a lawyer, so it wouldn't be as big a deal for me. It's pretty hard, for sure.  I try to keep cool with music, though.  I listen to blues and jazz to relax. Oh wow, that's really cool!  Do you like jazz as well? What type of music do you like? Do you listen to it while you're farming?"
Yeah tigers are a bit much for household pets.  Tiger or a puma for sure.  I like cats. I have a talent for getting them to like me too.  That's my way of thinking too.  I'm a ginger too.  I've always liked animals.  I took animal husbandry classes in 4H growing up.  Lambs. They're so cute. Foxes are a lot more adorable than I thought they would be as well. Not really related but I saw one in my neighborhood recently.  We're topped out on new houses around here. No more room for them. The foxes have a den in the drainage culvert area for the neighborhood. 
"I like to watch badminton videos to learn more techniques since I just recently started playing. It is. I have to change my diet to increase my stamina though, and I'm not a fan of fruits and veggies.  No. I graduated high school a few years ago. What about you? Really? Cool. I bet your diet is better than mine. LOL Do you workout? I really need to start working out so I can get better at badminton. That's a lot. Maybe if I start small I can work up to four miles"
"It was a cruise, but we stopped at multiple ports. St Lucia was my favorite. Have you ever been? We went to Sulfur springs. It is a drive in volcano!! it was really awesome! Also beautiful beach and sunset. It was our 20th anniversary and she really made it special. Thank you. It has been a wonderful 20 years. We were High school sweethearts. Yes,  I would not want to be trying to date in 2019.  I can not imagine how you would even meet people! all the dating websites, I would be lost!!"
"I really like movies with cars in them. I drive a Mustang I restored myself.  Cars are my thing. Anything that goes fast!  I think I got my love of cars from my dad.  Do you like cars? Understandable.  What do you do for a living? I know what you mean. My dad's a doctor but I disappointed him by becoming something less. That's what I say!  But apparently he doesn't think highly of dentists. I like it but I know people are glad when they leave, not when they arrive."
my mom doesn't cook. my dad used to do all the cooking but he passed away a few years ago. Thankfully I have hobbies that keep me busy. Have you heard of larping? You have probably seen these groups in parks or represented in movies.It's a game where a group of people dress up as characters and act out specific roles an scenarios. Oh wow! What has been your favorite so far? I love pasta. That sounds like a fun thing to learn how to make. I bet your boyfriend is happy that you're learning! What a neat surprise!
"No I didn't have pizza, but I usually get what I want anyway. Oh that sounds fun. Maybe I will have it tomorrow after school. Pepperoni with extra cheese. I am an only child so my mom lets me get it all the time Ew, I definitely do not like that at all. Well that is good you can have it all to yourself"
"It went well. This weekend we're going to a fall festival. Do you have any festivals where you live? I love the cool crisp weather. Hope it blows down here to Florida. We're having rain and humidity blech. How is your weather? Oh my! Lots of canadians come here for the winter!  I like the cold too but my daughter likes the heat here. She taught me how to program some, but I don't like it so I mostly substitute teach. You know it can be scary. I used to walk it at sunrise and the sound is deafening when it echo's off the condo's. I am fair skinned so can only go early morning or late evening. I watch it on my computer there is a web cam"
"no I just left the area He was just so obvious about it made my girlfriend nervous too Yeah it was weird have you had that experience That is the best move. We ended up leaving and going to a movie The Joker it was really good, you should see it Yeah you won't regret going don't think it would be the same watching at home"
"Soda is fattening, lol. I have 3 dogs I walk to burn calories on them and me! Do you have any pets? Mine are Chihuahua's also. They're my little doorbells, I call them. Is your cat indoor or outdoor? Cats are smart! We have lizards here and my cats loves to chase them when she escapes. I live in South Florida. Moved here after college and now can't get out, lol. My daughter hates cold and so won't move north. Where are you? Yes, dry air this weekend they say. Even that feels good! My girls is there alot for Disney.  Well it's nice to meet a fellow Floridian here! Enjoy those parks!!"
"I'm an amateur stand up comic.  I've been a fan of legendary comedians for years, so I thought I would try it myself.  I try to keep my comedy neutral so I don't really offend people.  LOL. That would be awesome. What are some of your hobbies? I'm too scared to gamble. I'm afraid I'll lose too much money, but I'm not afraid of deep sea diving. The Pacific ocean. I live on the west coast, so I have easy access. Have you tried it?"

"He is very annoying Sorry to hear that, do you have any tips on dealing with it?"

"Yes, I've become confident in myself over the past two years after losing my confidence. Thanks very much. I think it'll go well.  My divorce is in my rearview mirror and I'm looking forward to good things. Yes, it broke me up for a while but I'm feeling better now, two years later.  I also have my cats! Thanks.  What's going on in your life?  What do you do for a living? Yes, that would be great!  Any family?  Kids?  As I said, I've got my cats and that's it now. I understand.  That's one of the reasons I don't have kids.  What type of dog do you have?"
He was happy. I love to bake. Do you cook?
"Thats a great album!   Where do you live?  I am in the valley, love wide, open spaces.  That sounds beautiful.  We own a home with 5 acres.   We like it!  Plenty of room in case we decide to get animals! I love dogs, I am actually thinking of starting a labrador rescue.  Do you have any pets? Huskys are beautiful dogs!  I am sure the kids love him.  Does he shed alot?"
Better than being on my face though.  It was a little frightening. I took the dogs for a walk at the park and I'm good now.  Why is that an issue? Do you get confused? That's rough.  Words mean things you know? I take things too literally sometimes too.  Maybe you can avoid it entirely. You've gotten this far. Theatre has helped me with the taking things too literally. I go and watch plays.  If it makes you uncomfortable then maybe it's the way to go. It doesn't sound like you think they'll be very understanding. 
yes they gave it poison it really hurts me mine is ohangla vegan tooo no eating slept food
"are they a famous band? Where is the band Bon Iver from? oh ok, i never knew they were from America. do you like kids? yes I do too. I have 2 children of my own. Does the band Bon Iver also have alot of fans that support them? Yes, they get some fame, but not alot."

I wanted to just die, but don't like thinking about that subject, lol I love golf, and also filming. I carry a camera everywhere with me. You? Oh, ballet. My cousin was a ballet dancer.

They want alot of fame and to be payed attention too. I also have a friend that is like that too. They want everyone to feel sorry for them.  I just let it pass and not worry about it. doing that is not a good idea. that only starts trouble."
"it will be a new journey, a rewarding journey! how are you feeling? have you started your journey to know everything about Autism?

I was thinking of learning how to play a guitar over the summer, now I'm a little worried, haha. Would any kind of exercises help me build forearm strength to help me as a beginner? No, I don't, sadly. I still live with my parents, so I don't think they'd appreciate me making a lot of noise. I was thinking more of learning how to play on an acoustic guitar. Is playing an electric guitar easier? "
"Yes chocolate is amazing. Did you know it has antioxidants in it? Im sure you will get plenty of it at the park!  Hershey Pennsylvania is where Hershey's Chocolate comes from.

It's so odd how people don't understand the importance of what they eat.  Do you have any hobbies? My hobby is growing fruit trees. I got too good though, and had 80 mango's this year. TOO many, lol Yes, they are very sweet. There is a jamaican man that discovered my tree and so next year I may just hang bags of them for him to grab"

Yes exactly. Happiness is the most important thing. I see you enjoy shopping as well. What do you shop for? Cool. I love beef. It is very good for you. I'm glad you enjoy it."

"Well I am going on a fishing trip next week, so I would love to get some fresh fruits and vegetables to take with me! I try to, I go to Cherokee lake here in Tennessee, its only about an hour from home. I have, it's fun!  Do you enjoy waterspouts? haha, I meant water sports lol Me too!  Do you prefer the ocean, the lake, or the pool? Love the ocean, but don't go in the water.  We don't have alligators here so I love the lake!"
"He's pretty smart, it only took about a week I love my dog, we go swimming together I have trouble running since I lost my little toe. It was but it's getting better.  Sounds like it, it's probably hard to buy shoes No, I have to pad them a little."
It's coming along pretty well. Im trying to get it cleaned up to host a BBQ for my family. No we will grill out. Im excited to host everyone. That'd be nice. Mine is small which is why we need the garage space. Only about 1200 sq ft. It's enough for my husband and I though.
I'm too old for scuba diving.  Where do you dive at? Nice. I live on a lake too. I'm 70 years old now and got tired of people and retired to my cabin.  I do. They all live very far away though. I don't see them much.  They have their own lives to live. I don't mind it. We see each other a few times a year on holidays. It's true.  If you do a good job raising them then they leave the nest and stay gone.  That's fine. You have your own life to live though right?
"It was awful. What do you do for a living thats cool, I'm a writer myself All things under the sun. I dream of becoming an actress one day, writing helps me imagine different situations I have a dog. How many times have you been bitten? thats sweet lol Sneks, hah. I've thought of getting one but I don't want to feed it live stuff"
"My kids are all grown and out of the house and my wife is out of town for a week working Reading, Watching TV, and surfing the internet-what do you do for fun? Oh, so sorry to hear that-do medications help with it? At least you have a pretty good idea of what to avoid That is true-just have to keep moving forward and ignore the obstacles I will do that for sure-have to figure out what would be a nice night out when she gets home"
"That sounds awesome, did the humans eventually win? So now I'm confused, what kind of match are you talking about? What was the match about?"
"that's really interesting. i love peer-to-peer networks. do you have your own channel? you should get one. it's a great way to express yourself. do you live with your parents? i live with my dad, but i hardly ever see him. he works at a busy ad agency on madison avenue. what does your father do? wow, that sounds great. i love pizza, but my favorite food is tacos. in fact, i talk about cooking on my youtube channel. do you cook? you should go on allrecipes.com. they have user-submitted recipes that are top-notch. what have you made so far? i actually love trying at least one new recipe every week. i get bored making the same things all the time. are you a student?"
Which course you are study in college. which course you study in college? My favorite school subject is Mathematics. I am always like all subjects and Where are your college? I am royal college in UK.
That's all I have is home time.  I've got kids. Lots of kids.  Truer words were never spoken. I love them but I would like to get a break sometimes. 5 children are a lot to handle.  Not right now. We've got a fall break coming up soon though.  We're going to go to my parents house for Christmas. I'm looking forward to them getting some grandparent time.  They take the kiddos off my hands for me and it allows me to have some me time. It's nice to catch up with old friends.  Yeah. A lot of my friends from high school still live in the area. 
"it is old one My dog's name is drooly and ya he appears to seem okay. But I am kinda worried about his health Thanks for saying that. Vet expenses are too much these days. I guess it's because he is getting old. How about your dog? drooly is a male dog. he is nice, i hope your dog is not sick his favorite toy is a barbie doll. I guess he likes girls so much., haha. what about you? That's neat. That's a stressbuster"
"No i have not. Have you? Speaking of exploring, I'm gay and still in the closet so I know what you mean, just in a different way As do I my friend. So what are your hobbies? I've always wanted to try that. It sounds exhilerating! Im a freak for all things anime / manga / comic Me too!. I do like to hike also"
"Yeah, but I didn't want to risk getting a ticket myself. I'm not exactly sitting on stacks of cash, lol. Maybe if a publisher picks up on of the comics I'm making, then I'll have some money to spend on risking tickets. Since I'm trying to get into the business, I do all my own linework, color, lettering, etc. Hoping to work for Marvel. Teaching is always difficult. Luckily, nowadays artists can do well by publishing their work on the internet, which is what I've been doing.  There's always money in the food industry. Are you looking to start a chain?  I wish you luck! Better to be your own boss doing something you genuinely care about."
The barbarian I play bass guitar. I took lessons for three years. Are you self-taught? haha! seems like everyone is wired in these days. i became so frustrated with constant notification that  i live in bfe so it will probably take a few years before we get it. I'm from KC and bleed BBQ. it's my favorite too.
I did not know that. Please tell me more about this town Springfield. What are some of its attractions How is the weather there When would be the best time to visit it? Is it any good town for a vacation?
"But who knows maybe they have imaginary friends, I do and they keep me company Yeah, I live in LA and everyone is fake imaginary is better for me,  im sorry i understand i live next to miley cyrus and pnb rock so its hard to find real people"
"I'm alright! Just listened to a new audiobook last night and I really enjoyed it Oh! Maybe we can swap recommendations, so you'll have something to do while you're stuck in bed.  Do you have any preferences? I really like books about undersea adventures!  Hmm might not know anything to recommend, I mainly read fiction. What else do you like to do? Oh neat! Do you prefer things like puzzle adventure games or just plotlines that make you think in general?"
"That's cool, I'm too lazy to work. I prefer watching movies to working. I like to watch anything. How about you? Sweet, I love those movies too. I like the Fellowship Of The Ring the most. I enjoy watching reality shows like Big Brother. How about you?"
"nice to meet you on here, hope you don't mind if i get to know  oh, okay  oh that's good i love kids  nope i don't yet but i hope one day i'll have my own kids lol oh good, i like watching haven't tried it  yea, i play Tennis "

Yes, I especially enjoy the color of it. It can be real bright at times. A few, but there isn't many I like. What about you? I don't care for it much unless it is covered in cheese. Cheese is so good. I usually eat fruit before every meal too, but fruit and cheese don't mix lol."
I won it at the casino. I was playing the slots.  This is great because I'm in college and can use the extra money.
"The whole legal process is one of the most devastating parts of the divorce I wish there was a better way to address parental custody.  The kids suffer quite a bit with the uncertainty I agree that something must be done legislatively to make the divorce process better for everyone involved. Yeah ice cream for everyone!  That could take some of the pain out of a long day in court Do you think they should have puppies and kittens too? A lot of love is needed in such a tough situation, so anything that can promote some love is good with me"
"Hi, yes I love to watch races and cheer everyone on . I used to run but not lately. How long do you usually run? I did the 100 yard dash like I said in college, then hurt my knee a few years ago. That's good. We do need to be able to walk for sure and knee injuries are very painful. I know. I have spent many hours in waiting rooms and hospitals . I had the right knee injured from falling then shoulder injury, and broke some toes, lol."
"It sure was. However I know I could always turn to them for any king of help. It sure is. I often miss them since I live in different city. But making new friends always helps. I usually travel to different places, helping me meet new people and make new friends. Sightseeing, local attractions, bars, clubs. I never miss any chance to explore when I get it. I work double shifts. My last trip costed me a lot therefore I had to ask my parents for the money. What kind of hobbies do you have?"
"Yikes. I hope she got help. I have a sister who I hope doesn't develop those habits. Just starting out 1st grade. I'm glad. We are all hoarders in a sense. In a way, I like hoarding food. Costco lol. Things like ice cream. Indeed! But we have 2 freezers, so it's all good. They can last for a while. Isn't technology just great? My father uses that! He teaches quite a bit at middle school, so it makes it convenient for him when he goes home. It's all clean! But we must get the good kinds. I can't stand overly processed Ice creams. There are good brands out there who use healthy and quality ingredients. Yes. Just takes carefull looking at the grocery store. Organic section has good ones."
"But what if it's something bad I actually kinda like listening to Sinatra in situations like this Yea his music soothes me in this situation, i hope it all goes smootly. What are you up to ? I'm currenly having  a snack, i just love cheese Yea its lunch time here too on the east coast Jamaican ?"
"Does it get to be a problem with the snow? Which is worse, the rain or the snow? Really?! That's awesome. What position do you play? That's really cool. I've always wanted to compete professional in something. Awww. Thank you for that. How hard was it to get started playing professionally?"

"I know it's not the same as a slab of beef, but you can definitely load a burrito with steak. What is fish steak? I think I see what you're getting at. So, do you have any hobbies outside of steak appreciation? Oh, that's awesome! I've always wanted to try my hand at woodworking. Could you describe your latest project? Sounds simple enough. I like hiking around outdoors and hanging around with trees before they become boards. Yeah, the colors are starting to get really inspiring, seeing your breath and getting some exercise. It's great!"
"how come you're lazy  do you even have cash leftover after paying bills lol why do you buy alcohol oh, do you drink a lot oh interesting, why are you going to change this attitude at any point lol, i wish you goodluck"

oh okay. what kind of music do you like?  i hardly get time to be honest. I like pop and r&B Work mostly! you ever been to Hawaii?  Yeah. I have traveled a lot. My work requires me to travel. I was in Hawaii for a month.  on weekends only  I'm an IT Manager 
"it's not bad, i'm not highly religious at all just neutral everyone has their opinion really and that is toally fine What do you like to do then ? On netflix or cable ? What's your fav ? i am not a big fan"
"That sounds interesting. I'm an office drone, but I love to surf! At the beach, of course! Do you have any hobbies? Really? I like to ball up on occasion. What position do you normally play? So, all positions huh? I think it's fun to join a pickup game sometimes. Well, that's fine too. I find that anonymously participating helps with my social anxiety. Do you like music? Who is on your playlist right now?"
playing videogames mostly retro games mostly i think i need to buy new shirts too so ill probably go to the store whats it called? how are the prices? i usually go for sales as well
"That sounds so relaxing.  Do you have any pets? I also adore cats, have two of my own. One is grumpy all of the time and the other always gets into trouble. They are my babies. How about yours? I can't wait to get my hair done today. I'm getting bangs, kind of nervous about it. Yeah, I just need to change things up. Do you work?"
i like playing games so next 
"That sounds like a lot of work how much did it cost was it worth it ? Are you beautiful ? I think i am because my parents always told me that since i am the only child. I feel hot No i'm a man Men can be beaitufil as well, don't you agree ?"
"how old is it did you get him in a shelter where did you get the dog nice, is he friendly does he have name yet oh ok, i guess you dont want to discuss your dog anymore"
"I will find him and make him pay I don't want yours i want that specific one Are you good ? i would learn but i  am anti social and i would not want to go take piano lessons with anyone, i even work from home I'm too shy I'm also too shy to look at myself in the mirror,  I am trying hard to fix it"
"i felt bad for the guy, he looked a bit sad he just didnt seem happy doing his tricks, as if he did not care nope, I dont really use it that often I do! do you own any? absolutely, how old are they? thats awesome, go take them out!"
"I felt out of place because I have a few tattoos on my face. Yeah, I'm not crazy but I made a few mistakes when I was younger. It was a good office job, perhaps I should use some kind of makeup to cover it up for a future job. Do you work? I'm sorry to hear that. I hope things get better. Do you have any hobbies? That sounds like fun. I mostly listen to podcasts."
no i'm a plumber not a photographer!  My memory is good enough and I was in a hurry. You should get your eyes check out You could put them around your neck like one of my 4h members does. Were you the guy with the trashcan? I would have you come play for my members if you were!
"Yep, I reallyhave blond hair Why? I prefer to keep my hair natural. yeah it can Unless you get the cheap do it yourself kits at the store yep Nope, as I said before I like to keep my hair natural"
Oh I like playing computer games every now and then when I have time. If I had to pick I'd probably choose Minecraft. I'm always playing it at my computer and in bed. The other day I was playing and my dogs got surprised when they heard barking coming from my game. That was pretty entertaining. I tend to be a homebody too. I'm always in bed with my dogs listening to music or playing games. I can relate to that. Mine are my best friends. They definitely are. Dogs love you unconditionally. I'm not surprised they help keep you stable.
ok good colourful day nice to meet you god bless you dear thank you dear bye see you
"I'm sorry to hear that. Are you okay? I totally understand where you are coming from, my parents are educators. My dad teaches history and my mom teaches English. What do you plan on doing? That sounds like a noble deed. Sometimes my roommates make me want to find a new place. They smoke and play loud music. It gets annoying at times. I just work at the coffee shop. High school was more than enough for me."
"I usually get ready pretty quickly. What are you usually getting ready for? Oh, you have kids. How old are they? I'm sure, kids are always a handful. Does having children leave you any time for hobbies? And it's a noble one at that. Do you have any pets? I don't like animals either, their hair gets into everything. Nope, I'm out here all alone, but I love the peace and quiet."
"Yes, i instantly started singing a song about how bad it hurt.. I can't quite remember.. I was listening to music while I was singing! Anything with a nice beat to it really.. What do you like? That sounds amazing.. Music makes everything better to me.. I mainly just enjoy sining songs. No I don't.. I mainly just listen.. I wish I did!"
"Well I work in finance so I love doing anything that helps me with saving some money or helping others do the same. Well for starters, you should move closer to your job so you can walk there to save money, like me!"
"Yes, I like to sit around and drink beer. What about you? Wow that sounds fun.. I play basketball while waiting for my wife to finish cutting clients hair somedays. I work at a distrubition center, but for their finance department. I love Coors light the best!"
"I wonder what is best novel is. Can you recommend your favorite Stephen King book? I will read one and let you know what I think of it. Dan Brown has written some interesting mystery novels. The Da Vinci Code is excellent. I couldn't put it down once I started, so not long I imagine!"
"I misssed playing poll when there is an emergency I am a teacher and I also fear for my students What I means is I fear for them because of the hurricanes I teach art. It is my lifelong passion Not true! There is no such thing like thta.Art is art,regardless what type it is "
That is great though!  Still really good for the soul. I love to write actually! Creative writing actually. I teach it too!  How do you feel about writing? that is awesome!  What do you write about? It really is another great thing for you.  What other hobbies do you have? I love it too!  All kinds!
"Yes, he loves the sport more than anything.. It keeps him out of trouble for sure! Wow that is so awesome! Sometimes I am working late as a yoga instuctor so it is good to have him there where I know he is safe. It is something that you should always make time for, it makes your body so much stronger and healthier! Well something crazy like that is always going to be worth it in the end.. I hope it works out for you like my Yoga has for me! Wow! I would love to come to one of those to blow off some stress myself! For sure, I would love to come and spend some time and watch how you work!"
"Yes.. It still makes me upset.. I am hoping they will go see the sunset with me tonight. Those are my favorite. Yes, some nights I will just sit there for hours and think as it goes down. Yes, something I also enjoy just as much is watching the sun rise.. Some months I don't miss a single day! Yes! I have before on a cruise, it felt way more beautiful.. I would do anything to get to see it agaun! Yes, it is by far one of my best memories I went to Hawaii! It was 10 days long and it was awesome, I woudl love to go back! "
"I love to go fishing.. Ever since my parents divorce it has really helped me. Anything calm.. Classical is my faovrite because it helps me when I study. What about youself? Wow! I have heard some people say that, although it is very crazy sounding to me! Yes, that definitely makes sense to me! Some kids at my school listen to that aound me as I study. Wow! That's so great to show the music you like from your clothing style! I am currently a student. I do very well in school with great grades."
"Yes. I try to be a good role model myself.  I completely agree. I try to present myself as having acheived a lot, but still down to earth. How about you?"
"Gosh that was such a great album.  My son and I really got into that band together. Is that the album that the song, Radioactive, was on? Are there any other bands that you're a fan of? Are they originally a Canadian band? What are you trying to compete professionally in? Well cool.  My son and I love listening to music, maybe we'll see one of your shows one day!"
"I voted for Hillary Clinton because I love hiking and so does she. How about you? Will you dress up for Halloween? That's awesome! I love rock music, once I went with my three brothers as the Beatles for Halloween! Maybe a solo costume this year. David Bowie would be cool. Would you go bald for it or are you already prepared? Yeah, that'd be a big commitment to shave your head just for a costume. Are you going to a party, or just handing out candy at home or something?"
"Yes, they found footprints It is very frustrating. I wish I had installed an alarm system. I think I will get a dog to give me a sense of protection I wonder what breeds are good guard dogs. Yes, the bark could ward off invaders as well as the ""Beware of Dog"" sign Do you have any advice on recovering from a robbery?"
"Well, she was scammed through phishing and no way of getting it back. I went to Princeton and still couldn't help her. That happened to you before? It's a terrible thing, I'm sorry for you. couch surfing in Europe sounds fun though. Was it great? YOU ways to protect yourself should be used. I've been listening to Bach and other classical music to help lessen my stress from my mom's phishing scam she went through. It's amazing! That kind of music really takes away the stresses of daily life. Are things better for you now? Great. I hope one day I can go to Europe. Any suggestions of places to visit? Definitely France! I guess that's quite common, huh?"
"At least I got the discounts, now I can use the money I saved to go out this weekend! What do you like to do? Yeah, we always have that on the TV in the pizza place where I work part time. Seems like a weird choice but it's a decent show. Yaaas of course. Do you think they are a good match? What do you like to do for fun? I love to party. The UK, Egypt, typical stuff. What kind of food do you like? No, what kinds of things are particular to Kenyan food?"
"My cousin had a trditional upbringing whereas, I was raised by 2 mothers. Maybe that's why I don't do well in sports! lol I think I do. My boyfriend says so anyway. He is very smart and works  for nasa! Wish I had that job. What do you do for a living? One of my mothers is a Realtor. She loves it. I have learned a lot about the market from her. How long have you been a Realtor? I am a full-time student and I work part-time as a tutor in Writing and grammar.  No. I am a Biology major with a minor in computer science. I hope for anything science related, maybe DNA research. I really want to get into Bioinformatics, but I will need more school!"
"Yeah but I don't trust those apps.  They violate your privacy. Hey!  Back to what we were talking about, what food do you like? Ever had lutefish at an Italian restaurant?  It's the best. Yep.  It's a bit of a rarity but well worth looking for it.  You want to come with me next week to eat it? Ha!  You're funny.  I think there's a Marduk concert going on as well.  Are you a Marduk fan? Well what music do you like?"
"Yeah I do, but i love music more I like Game of Thrones too. Good stuff. Like to read it with a nice drink. Yes. Like to watch it while drinking cuba libre YEs. I like to drink it while watching shows or performing at the theater music rock and roll"
"I think she did. It was hard to tell, but I believe she did. I think she also liked having my cat, KJ, on her lap. She was! :-) 8. She's getting a little gray around the whiskers. Tortoise shell. She's adorable! My only complaint is she likes to wrap herself around my legs when I'm cooking, which i do alot. Do you have pets? Do you want a cat, a dog, or something else?"
"Did they even taste like bread? I wonder if it tasted like mystery flavor, that is my favorite. What is yours? I think it is also a good choice. It is always hard for me to pick. I see all the cake and get too excited and then argue with myself about what I want. That's why I like mystery, you never know what it will be. Well, it does help if you like all cake. Good thing i'll always love cake!"
"Six Flags. I'm so lucky. Yup. We don't get to go that often, so it's a real treat to go. It's still pretty far. But roller coasters are my favorite ride. What's yours? Those are the best. Do you have any plans to visit an amusement park, even though it's not nearby? Your neighbor is lucky to have someone like you helping them! That's great. Reminds me of how I feel of my family."
"Well my dad gave me this cheap car, and I think it's letting out some weird fumes. That would be a great idea. I always have a ton of energy so maybe I could learn. I'm just really skinny and energetic, I'm not sure! It's impressive to work in a big company though."
"I can't believe the fire burned my house down. I've never had to work, but now I might. It's rough, right? I haven't worked a single day in my life. What about you? Wow that's an early age. What do you do? My brother and sister in law stay at campgrounds sometimes. She dislikes me, though, I'm not sure why. Well I can be a pain sometimes haha! What's the best part about running a campground? A few times, but never in the woods. Is it dangerous?"
"I'm a worrier and a planner and always have been. I guess it's just part of that Type A personality. What about you? I'm sorry to hear that. It must have been hard growing up. I can see how that would make someone want to have a plan and know what to expect. I do, I have a three year old daughter and a sixteen month old son. They are a handful! That's cool, what are your tattoos of? I don't have any but have considered getting something small. I like the idea of a meaningful quote or my kids' names. I also love animals, so an animal tattoo would be cool. It's definitely an idea I've been entertaining. I don't think my boss would mind if it was visible, so that's not really a consideration."
"For the better...I'm still insecure though. By working harder....but i work too many hours. Yes, in moderation....What's your story? What else is going on with you? That's awesome.....seeing those strong dudes makes me insecure. i don't have time...too many working hours."
"He was in college for 4 years. He studied Business Management with a minor in Vet Sciences.  He loves animals! Yes, I think he's going to. He graduated from Northwestern.  He's glad to be finished with school for a little while. Me too!  I like to learn but I'm getting too old.  I love animals though, so I hope he becomes a vet. It was really great talking to you!"
The plants are amazing
"Oh wow! I've heard that there are courses online for that. How did you get a degree?  I'm taking courses online for contracting so maybe I can afford a house one day. You sound successful! I really like Prince, Jack White, The Grateful Dead. I collect vinyl. How about you? Radiohead is AWESOME Thom is the man! I've seen them live!"
"what kind of car? what color? nice! I don't like smaller cars. I have a bigger car hyandui santa fe No, I am paying it off though to own it soon."
Ohh i am like also I am like as pet
"That sounds fun! I'm an only child and had wished many times I had someone to camp with as a kid. Yes, Boy Scouts sure did! Were you in them? That's fun I'm sure. My parents divorced early, caused me not not believe in love anymore, so I'm still alone That's great. Maybe I'll change my mind one day, or find it. One can hope. Are you married? Wonderful. Y'all every go camping? It's so fun"
ok i'm trying to relax yeah is a fun interiew for a job  mehnician work ohh i am also like interviews some peoples activities is anger me
I love kids too! How many do they have? I moved into an apartment recently close to my job. There's a school nearby and I hear them every morning! Probably playing Fortnite and doing kid stuff. When I was a child we played outside. Do you feel it's made you a happier person? Kids today are crazy with the school shootings. Never happened in the 80s It's unfortunate. It's a reason I conceal carry but I'm a Texan. I wish the world was safer. You seem like a good person. Absolutely. I'd love to see Beto come try to disarm Texas LOL
They weren't returned! I had to replace everything including my barbie gift card!  It is a bad feeling.

Until they start climbing your curtains and getting stuck up on doors. Mine does that sometimes."

"I like to eat omelets the best. Over medium eggs are ok as well. I ate them that way before I retired, but I no longer do. I agree, hard boiled eggs do not taste good unless they are as deviled eggs. I never have. It is usually onions, peppers, and tomatoes on my omelets.  It is really easy. I will meal prep for a couple of days and chop all the vegetables and seal them in Tupperware in the fridge. I use the internet to find different vegetarian recipes. "

That sound awesome. I hope you get to visit there someday. I really want to go to Scotland someday.
"What's your favorite built? What about Aluminum appliances? More environmentally friendly. It is very important for future generations.

Addiction is a hard thing to handle, but there are a lot of places that can help"

"Yes, he talks to her like everyday and seeks her advice. No, I think she's flirting with him some of the time. I really don't like her I mean I I agree. I meant to say I'm a yoga instructor, so I should probably take some of my classes to relax.. We do both! We have quiet sessions and then more louder sessions that are also for fun and not as serious I personally think pop music and EDM type music gets people going the most.

There are only 3 species of Zebra and they are found in Africa Yes, i don't understand why would someone want to kill such a beautiful animal for fun. Last year I had gone to Africa with my boyfriend and got to see them in the wild. They are magnificent animals.  The Masai Mara in Kenya is the best place to see them up close"
"I'm 18 and getting preparing for college. I haven't decided on a major yet. That's a good plan to save money instead of paying rent for a dorm room. I understand the feeling of wanting to be alone. You will have more privacy in a dorm room. I'm going to live in a all male dormitory and a single room.  No, I have scholarships to cover my tuition and most of my dorm's cost. Yes, but I also applied for many scholarships and earned enough to pay for most expenses."

"That's pretty cool. Have you ever been to Japan? Nice, are you traveling for work or vacation? Are you by yourself or with family? Nice! I have three kids, so taking them anywhere basically triples the price since we have to get 2 hotel rooms Interesting. I've heard that homes are really different than in the US. Like they are super close together Yeah I guess that makes since. I personally want my own lot, without sharing any walls with people. Whatever floats your boat!"
"Ugh. And now I'm finding out in all this new research that peanut allergies MAY have been avoided! I haven't read much about it. But mostly if you expose your kids early, blah blah blah I think the idea is that if they get sick once, you slowly introduce them to the product. I'm no scientist, but it makes sense. Huh? Honestly I don’t know the science. But I *have* been on a plane where they told me not to open any peanut stuff because of some rando Oh come on. You're not even allergic to poison ivy?"
"Thanks, I think that having a positive attitude and grinding hard will help! Only if the work is put in though.. The universe will Humble you without doing the work That's for sure, Your niece sounds like a smart person. Im excited to get this exam done tomorrow though Finance, I am majoring in Business. Thank you for the kind words. I am looking forward to camping out this weekend Well, I just bought a camper (First time) so this is completely new to me.

"i love it. we get to play outside a lot what do you do? it is not fun to be outside in the heat for too long We do get to play music, and instruments. My mom teaches at my school. It is a lot of fun at preschool. My dad works at a warehouse. He works outside in the heat too sometimes"
"California is nice. It has perfect weather for exercising. What kind of activities do you like? I like music too. What sort of music does ""The Story So Far"" play?

What is your favorite sport?"
"You are so lucky. I would love to be able to do that.  So what else do you like to do? Do you also race professionally or just for fun? It looks so dangerous but like so much fun. Really, I never heard that. That is so cool. I am not that good at that, but I bet I can beat you at pool."
"indeed. but they can also drive you crazy. just one. please don't get me wrong, I love him so much I am just ranting as usual in my age. he is in his in his late 20's. as I said before, he was here recently and it was great! I'm not a coffee person but I do love animals I currently have a cat, do you have any animals? Kitty. OK, I know not very original but it was the first name I called and she turned her head so I just kept it"
"That might be a good idea. I like technology so I should probably look online too I think there are a lot of liars though. I only date people taller than me and I think people might lie about their height Oh, that's a delicate subject. But if someone doesn't like you because of your employment status then they're probably not the right person Ok fine, maybe that's BS. Well you can get back on your feet and get back into the dating game Having a part time job is better than no job! There's nothing wrong with starting from the ground If you had a job, it should be fairly easy to get a part-time job somewhere. Unless you have a medical condition?"
"Wow! That's pretty neat. Do you fish often? Nice. I've been trying to go more often, but work gets in the way. Will definitely have to try fishing from a kayak.  I'm a huge hockey fan. I play ice hockey in a community league. What about yourself? Any trails you recommend? Haven't been hiking that much. Some friends have been talking about going for a while, so I thought I'd get some recommendations Thanks! You seem really knowledgeable about the outdoors. What other activities do you do?"
"Next week! It'll really help with my career since I need to run around the city Not yet, next week I will hopefully. do you have yours yet? oh yea parallel parking is hard. i'm in the city to be a fashion designer and i'll need to parallel park a lot. are you in a city? oh very cool i'm in nyc, i heard driving in chicago is hectic too oh yea probably gridlock. I haven't had to drive all my years in the city yet til now oh that is very cute, i hope to have a car inspired by alexander mcqueen"
"My two kids will be so disappointed.  I just recently went through a divorce and now this I am thinking about having my mom bake something special for them.

"That is true. I still love it though, even though it's not healthy Thanks for understanding. Do you wear makeup? I guess it might have gotten in the way. I sell makeup and cosmetics to make a bit of extra money. That is awesome. Do you sleep in the back of the truck sometimes? Avon, mostly. Did it get expensive staying in hotels often? Or was it covered by the truck company? That's good. I imagine it gets a bit boring and lonely on the longer drives."
I am going to Seattle. Its my favorite place to visit. I just like the atmosphere. Oh and I love Frasier.  Dr Crane is great. I'm not.  I watched Frasier on Hallmark last night with my wife. Maris is actually Niles ex wife.
"Maybe not, but I hope I can learn from my mistake. I don't think my family can forgive me, especially my Mom."
"That reminds me, I need to catch up on the episodes, I am so far behind. There is just so many shows out. It is hard to find the time.  So what other artists do you like? I could go for some Coldplay right now. I love them. They are definitely one of the artists I listen to when I am working. It keeps me focused, just the music and the numbers. I am an accountant."
"Well I get an employee discount. It is usually around 20% off. Oh I feel you on that one. Although I think it helped me settle in a little after moving for University. I studied computer science. Did you attend any university? That's pretty funny. My roommate and I got along okay, but we didn't talk a whole lot. No not really. He transferred to another school after a couple years. That's life I guess. I ended up moving in with some people I still talk to though."
My husband is french and our child can naturally speak english and french without an accent showing either way is her primary language I feel like that is true. Yeah it is harder as we get older as well. I think thats why it is so cool for her to learn from the start I am hopeful that it pays off for her when she is an adult and working. Yes. I am wanting to homeschool her and feel like at this point I barely work so it is possible It is such a rewarding experience for families. My mom taught me that way and my husband is happy to know I want to teach our one little one.
"I think I'd say ""End of Watch."" Have you ever seen it? It's a police drama. Jake Gylenhaal is pretty good in it.  I've been playing Apex Legends quite a bit but I am not very good. What type of game was it? I've always been curious how they decide whether to make games realistic or not. Is it a lot different from what you usually play?"
"What do you love about winter? I love doing things outdoors when it's warm, especially fishing! Do you like being outdoors? Swimming! I'm lucky to have a pool. I'm in the south, too. Yes, because I like to go for midnight swims! Do you do any winter sports? No, my family lives out west, so it's pretty quiet around the holidays for me. How about you? That's the one great thing about cold weather: baking, without heating up the house!"
"I was able to spend the last days with her though which were special What do you enjoy in your spare time? I love reading and playing with my dogs Any particular types? I love horror, thriller, and crime type movies also. Anything else and I need to bribe my husband to go hahaha I agree. It is hard to find anything worth seeing in the theater. Now I just want til I can watch it at home Yes. I love watching movies where I have read the book. I like seeing if it matches up"
I am thinking about Hawaii I like to go to the beach yes I used to work for a cable company and they sent me there once I have only been to Honolulu it is like a big city with a beach. I want to go to other islands. I take rain everywhere I go even there I usually love rain but after a week of non stop rain I want sun  It rains a lot where I live. That is why I have to take trips to the beach.
"Wow. Do you like the food there? I love their tradition and cultures. Of course. It's truly fascinating how much cultures we have in a single planet. I would love to visit too. Honestly, it's the only place I would love to visit. Mainly because we share the same language. I would love to learn French. It sure is. And some fashionable clothes."
"I like to bake a lot. It relaxes me. And I'm getting *slightly* better at giving away what I make rather than eating it all :) Oh, I've never had it, but it sounds delicious. I'm really getting into making different types of cookies. What are some Filipino desserts? No, I'd imagine not! Chocolate chip are my favorite. I need to stop with the carbs though. Between those and bagels--too much! Have you had the ""everything"" bagels? They have, well, everything you can think of on them. They're excellent What did you call them? Haha! I'm sure the traditional name sounds better :)"

"Nature is so wild up there; it must be amazing to see it up close! It's on mine, too! I'd love to say I've been to all 50 states! Wouldn't you love to pet a panda? Ooh, that's a tough one...maybe otters, because they're just so playful! LOL, I watched them going down a water slide, over and over...so fun and funny! I know what you mean about zoos, me too. It's still warm here; I might have to mow my lawn again! My tomato plants are blooming again, which is kind of fun, but, seriously...in October?!?"
I like thick crust too and local pizza is so good Oh I have never had it but I have always wanted to try it. I love dipping the crust in dipping sauce.

"College. Are you in school? Very cool. Who is your favorite author? I enjoy reading Stephen King novels I like to read the Bible too I'm a seventh day adventist so I study it a lot I agree, that it is one of my favorite parts about it"
I still have to wait for more tests but I think it will be okay Yes I have to do lots of yoga to stay calm oh I should try that with my kids I like to get away on dates with my husband There are some very good restaurants in the area I love to eat too but it is hard to leave the kids and get away
I like walking at the park near my place. How often do you fish? Nice! How long have you been fishing for? You must be an expert. I've been a few times when going camping. Been on any neat trips recently? I used to be. But haven't been able to recently because of work
"Yeah, turned out ok overall. Probably, gave good customer service and fixed the issue no worry. Accidents happen, so long as they're aware of it and fix it, I wouldn't stop service. I'm a fan of Italian! You? I could go for anything really... shrimp scampi? If I hadn't eaten earlier I'd for sure make something, but I think I'm all set for now. Everything's so good though!"

"I really want to get better at coding so I can develop my own game one day. It seems like virtual legos. Once you know how to put them together there are endless possibilities! Is there a certain type of game you're interested in? Hmmm, tough choice as I like a lot of genres! I like Moba's and MMO's, but I have a serious addiction to minecraft atm, lol Nice! What's the last thing you built on it? (If you can recall) Hey bases are cool too! lol  I'm working on a replica of the town in Stardew atm. Do you play games often?

Maybe she could ride around with me in my Corvette."

"Oh the noises don't really bother me.  you get used to it.  I prefer the night even. Oh no, sorry to hear that.  I have had a lot of failed relationships too.  What usually happens? Same here - I have women calling me all the time in fact.  There are just too many choices! At some point you have to settle down though.  It is a more satisfying life if you can meet one person. That's a good plan.  You have to focus on the right things at each stage in life. Yes, I am. But I'm much older than you.  My college days are long gone."
"That's true, but sometimes they don't get the history exactly right in order for it to be really educational. I like hiking and listening to music. It is and I can do both of those at the same time which is nice. Are you close with your family? Mine doesn't like the things I do, like One Direction. They hate One Direction. That is sweet, I bet they miss you also! What kind of music do you listen to? "
"I do! I go to techno shows when I can get some time off from my jobs, I work at Target and Mcdonalds and Uber. Do you like techno? What is your favorite techno artist? Oh nice, I miss techno from the 90's so much. It was so carefree, I wish society could go back a bit. I haven't watched much anime, could you recommend a show to watch?

Yes many peple Me too Battlefield3 Yes me too Same feel I would love to able to have \horses
"Me too! I'll try and get good sleep tonight. Anything to help! Actually, I have always wanted to practice it. I just have never started.  I certainly need that. It might help with my worry over speaking in public.  I am a vegetarian though, I believe that also helps me to be healthy and keep my mind clear. Do you ever have to speak in public? It was at first. I'm not actually opposed to meat or dairy but I found many foods I enjoy and that helped a lot. So now it comes easy.  No, I have trouble with it. I noticed you sell jewelry what kind?"

I like the Giants as well, they have a lot of heart."
"Yes, but I love being a pilot Not at all, I had a hard time with numbers Yes, I love to travel. Flying for Southwest allowed for me to see the world Yes, the longer I work, the better the trips are Yes, going as a whole family is great.

I need to find something I enjoy in life and make it a career. What do you do for a living? Does that get boring at all for you?
"That's what I used to do.  I have learned other ways of managing or reducing stress. I take deep breaths and remind myself that how I react and handle things or situations reflects on me.   No problem!   I do not.  However, I like to keep a small garden outside of my house. I love carrots so that is what I am planting right now.   Yes it can be.  What sports do you play?"

I tried it for the first time about a month ago and I loved it! I highly recommend it. What other dishes do you like?"
"I don't know perhaps it the way it is cut and marinated That is true, but you have to know how to cook a steak. And nothing beats a good old cast iron skillet. How many minutes do you leave that on the coals? Direct heat or just offset? so if it's done offset that gives it a good smoked quality? Do you have to have a certain wood? Like oak or apple wood? Oh I bet that is good. I do liked good smoked meat with that deep smoked flavor. Nothing can beat that!"
"What type of dog do you have? No, my cat was 13 years old and was my best friend. Trying to lighten the mood a bit, what do you like to do for fun? My favorite drink is iced coffee (even when it gets cold). Where do you like to get coffee?

I've been married for a while an love my inlaws. I think that is rare."
"I've tried a few yoga classes but I mainly like to run. That's true.  I have access to a gym though with treadmills and indoor track. Sometimes.

I used to live on the coast where seafood was a lot better.  How about you? Yeah, that's the problem a lot of places in the middle of America.  Far from anywhere you get good seafood. No.  I used to smoke cigarettes for years, but finally quit.  I never really smoked a pipe. Well, if you don't smoke often, then it probably isn't too much of a problem.  But always better to quit"

"Folks say that trucks are not that much different.  Just a little top heavy. True.  But when you're moving, it's great to get everything done in one trip. Not question about that.  I heard there are some really good restaurants along that corridor. It's like a really good road trip, with family, new restaurants, and good music.  Especially 80's rock. Same here.  Old time rock and roll is the best music.  Can you even call the new stuff 'music' these days? Same for me and my partner.  But the kids cringe at the thought.  Are you traveling anytime soon?"

But it's hard to share my feelings.  Because I don't believe anyone cares.  And I drink a lot. I don't.  It's not everyday.  It happened after I lost someone I loved. Relationship.  Now I have my doubts about love.  It's not real."

Yes of course, you must be a responsible parent. Maybe someday I will achieve that. Yes I can't wait to be a father. However my ex-wife wishes impotence on me every day!"

I will figure that out as my kiddos get older Indeed. Have a good night. "
"I'm really glad hitchhiking is free and popular because I really enjoy it. It offers me a chance to talk to other people from around the country. Yea, I especially enjoy it since I live alone and don't really have anyone to interact with on a daily basis. Yup me too. When I'm hitchhiking and in the car with another person, I usually start talking about philosophical stuff like the meaning of existence. Oh? what topic do you enjoy discussing then? I understand hunters who hunt for food. However, I never understand people who under for ""fun"" or for ""sport"". Do you hunt for ""fun"" and not for food? Yup eating fresh food that you catch yourself makes sense. Do you hunt for ""fun"" though?"

"Wouldn't you get in trouble with the law for doing that? Well, no offense, but that just doesn't seem very sanitary at all, haha. Can you tell me more about what a garbage plate is? Maybe it's for the best that I don't know, it sounds messy and I hate cleaning up. Hah, that's unfortunate. I have to do all the cleaning for myself, wish I had someone to do it for me. I'm afraid I'll have to politely decline, but good luck with your divorce. Hopefully that situation doesn't turn into a garbage plate! Well, I'd tell you not to be so blue about it, but unfortunately blue is my favorite color, so sadly I don't think I can help you there."
They are going to name him John. What kind of food do you like to cook? Oh I love Chinese food so much. I tend to eat too much fast food though.  I drive out in my passat and get fast food at least once a day.  I like to frequent Chinese buffets. They are my weak spot.  Same here! I love going to Hibachi buffets. I could sit there for hours.

"I never pass up a chance to go to Olive Garden. Their salad is awesome! Probably not but I still love it. My adoptive family is Italian and they say the same thing. Nothing like authentic cuisine. Someone is grumpy! Did you not eat to today and it's making you cranky?! No, but I would love to someday, if I could get past the idea of a plane ride. Well hopefully you will get to visit in the near future. All that history and Italian food!! Maybe if we could ensure we slept the whole flight....maybe some dramamine. I probably spelled that wrong."
"Have you tried water skiiing before Yes, I like the thought of them. It's just that I'm scared when I actually have to do them Yes, as long as I am wearing my red bathing suit. Red things calm me down I like the beach some, the sand is beautiful. What about you? I would love to have a beach house. A red one, probably. How long have you had it? Reasonably close, probably about a 45 minute drive. Do you take family and friends there?"
"It was enough money to me -- $10 is not insignificant Exactly. I just wish banks were not so greedy with these fees I did, and they did finally fix it so I'm feeling a bit better. Especially after some spaghetti and ice cream! Pasta has always been my comfort food! And I can eat ice cream any time of year :) I love most flavors - but I agree, cookies 'n cream is awesome! I am partial to chocolate too I must admit it's not the best for my waistline, but it just hits the spot!!"
"The circus is the best place in the world. I've worked there for years. Role playing. I come out to the loudest Country music song I can find and get the crowd stirred up Started 3 years ago. Do you go? If so, where? That's good work. I love animals. You a dog or cat person? One dog. Mixed breed, best kind IMO. Sleeping on the couch now Same here. She's loves my favortive music and goes with me to the circus. Not a fan of the make-up though"
I think you are correct on that! I really love bentelys. I think they are the best car around! What happened to it? Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. The memories are what is important.  They really are. It's something about how they were built. 
"I have many siblings and none of them wear glasses. How come I am the one who ended up with needing a pair?! no, I prefer to be creative and draw. I think I got glasses because I used to watch a lot of TV haha, indeed. I like libraries, I find them very quite and relaxing. Do you work in a big city library?  well, sometimes smaller gems are better but don't stop aspiring! I am a storyboard artists - hence my love to draw well it is kind of a mix between the two"
"I believe if was Night of the Living Dead! Indeed! So, what are your favorite pastimes?  Yes I like it also! Hmm, my biggest fear is running out of money, which would force me to drop out of school before graduating! Haha I haaate spiders also! I had to kill a huge one the other day since I was the only adult around at work I am a christian, what about you? I don't pray as much as I should, although I try to act like a good christian... that counts, right?"
"There are many people of diverse backgrounds. I meet many of them on a daily basis in my factory work Oh no, that sounds stressful! Do you know any one who is a part of it That's terrible, my heart goes out to him. Seattle is such a nice city, is the strike happening there? Not too bad, just enjoying Seattle, just got back from a walk. What about you? It's been moderately warm the past few days, rain has let up. What are you working on? That's an interesting perspective. I used to work several jobst throughout the day, so I can somewhat relate"
"o ok neat are u familiar with noodling for fish? i dont think i will, i dont want to get bit lol i enjoy listening to classic rock that is very true, what are some of your hobbies? that is neat, are you enjoying it? thats good, im sure its good exercise as well"
"He is an amazing bassist of my all-time favorite band! Probably ""The Trooper,"" what about you? Good choice!  Do you have other interests other than music? Awesome!  My family and I spend a lot of time binge watching on Netflix actually. With the family we are working through ""Heartland,"" but alone I really got into ""Mindhunter.""  You? Me too! It's funny how different those two shows are, but both so well done. The great thing about binge watching is you can keep going, but the worst thing is waiting for the next season when you get caught up!"
Me too! Whats your favorite way to make friends Thats cool! I really like to go to parties. Are you an outdoors person?  I love hiking and mountain biking outdoors.

"I plan on visiting the Grand Canyon on Friday, and we're going to the movies on Saturday. I am going to see the new Twilight movie with my sister and girlfriend. So you only work part-time. Are you going to school? Sorry to hear your roommate is annoying. What does he do everyday? He sounds like a lazy guy. I hope you find a better job to rent your own apartment. That is very funny. Me and my girlfriend are looking to get an apartment soon."
Oh no! Why are you so tired all the time? Oh geez! I am sorry. I am tired too. I work so much :( And school is a lot too. What do you do to be healthy? Wow! Doesn't that get expensive? True! What do you want to do for a living? I enjoy working on cars. I also like working with animal;s Oh I AM the animal shelter lol!
"That means you actually like watching people loose their money! Is their anything else you consider fun? Sorry autocorrect before, its was supposed to be ""There"". Anyway, I love traveling too, but no kids yet as I recently got married! Thank you very much. We're still on our honeymoon phase Is that so? I love kids though. I have 2 siblings and my brother is 12years younger than me. Oh he's a handful!  That's so sweet! "
"Do you think there's a language that only depressed people understand? I'm so sorry you were feeling that way. How did you cope with it? What did you learn? I was watching a spanish movie where the character was depressed and he learned so much, too Cool, that must have been hard. It's different for everyone That's good. What made you realise it wasn't impossible? That's really inspirational. I don't think movies ever get it right when they portray depression, as much as I like movies"
I'm shocked they knew just what to get me. I'm glad I have such good friends.
hopefully by the first of the year philosophies. What have you studied?  Much respect. Nurses put up with a lot. You work late nights?  Can you take your meals? I try to take my meals when I work.  What kind of TV shows do you like? I watch Jimmy Fallon every night. Sorry to hear that. When I miss a show I usually catch it on Youtube
"Was that the one about the people living in New York with the weird neighbor? Oh, right. I've seen that all over Netflix now. I've been meaning to watch that. Is it good? Sounds good! I will try to look it up and give it a watch! I'm kind of in the middle of a classic anime right now. Seven Deadly Sins. I watched it several years ago and just decided to re-watch it. I had forgotten how good it was! A group of warriors with special powers. It's back story is very involved and unfolds over the course of the show.  I have! I went on a class trip when I was in primary school. We had a wonderful tour of London."
It's funny i first learned to love pickles at karaoke night i was offered one. After that i was hooked! That's awesome that they don't cost that much! And thank you! Eggs are okay i like them in the morning! Very true! How about coffee? I like camomile tea! somes black tea Milk goes great in tea! honey too. You have great tastes!
Oh I have dealt with so many like that my whole life so I know it well! Oh somewhat! You can't let them turn you into them you know? Oh man! But do you still like being in the navy? Oh I am working on school but I also run a few businesses. Not enough time in the day Oh working for a few companies kind of self employed and also selling things on the side. Well I am doing ok!
"Oh yeah! Most definitely.  I have two dogs and a twin sister if you count her, haha what about you? A squirrel?? That's pretty awesome!  Oh my gosh, I'm such an animal lover and that's so sweet. Aww! True that! They may end up being best friends. oh yea without a doubt"
"He's a basset/lab mix. That's cool! I have friends with pitties, and they are super-sweet dogs. Does your dog like to play frisbee?  Fun! I meant just catching it and bringing it back.  My dog loves to play.  Is ultimate frisbee like frisbee golf? That sounds really fun. Yeah. Just for fun with friends and family.  None of us are very good, but it's nice to do stuff outside.   mostly just going for walks and hikes and playing fetch.  His lab side always wants to do stuff, but his bassett hound side is lazy :-) "
Working 8 day a week and school yes. i mean to say 8 hours a day. haha How your day been going?
"I know right, I've been in such a funk over it for the past week,since I found out. I've been saving up to buy a new camera, looks like I need to go ahead and get it and take lots of photos of her! I know, I know.  I'll just miss seeing her long pretty hair blowing in the breeze the most.  Her hair is as long as mine. I've had long hair all my life.  I have photos of myself as a baby in pigtails. Lol Which makes me sad, because my daughter had pigtails when she was a baby too: ( Yes, very proud and I'm glad in a way she's taking this step to the next stage in her life."
"I don't smoke anymore. I quit six years ago. Best thing I ever did. I still smoke cannabis, but that's harmless. Great for relaxation, as well. Well...yeah. I have a nephew who is a fitness freak. Smokes cannabis daily. It helps him focus on his runs. Definitely. I travel to Colorado every other month. Six hour drive, but I love doing it. Nah. I never bring any back. You will LOVE the high though. Your imagination will soar! Try it. You will love it. "
"Why is that awesome i'm going to die? Very true! i'm trying my best to enjoy it Kinda of lame but see that grand canyon  Thats a great idea! i'll add that to the list! Its basic but true, Live life to the fullest and don't let the small things get to you! Awesome i hope i looks good!"
"no i dont have a favorite but i love the show true detective is my number 1 fave its more of a fictional crime type, matthew mcconaughey and woody harrelson yes it is pretty awesome, i love it yes i was a huge fan of the books as well hanging out with my best fried roy who happens to be my dog"
Working with dogs would be awesome. My dream job is run my own thrift store while also doing online work I enjoy having some drinks with good company.  I normally keep it simple but I have achieved a few hangovers over the years Everything from affordable clothes to interesting collectibles. I would even like a table where you can take something and leave something at will I am a big fan of thrift stores and video games. I still love the vintage ones for sure.  Heck yes! And then junk food and video games
"Wow! What do you write? Do you like reading as well? Who is your favorite author/ Oh like Fantastic Voyage? I've never read it, but it's sitting on my bookshelf. Same! Are you currently reading anything?"
the great us of america?
I haven't eletronic. they're the best concerts to go to I don't know. I just like the sound and beats and it's fun to listen to not really. I should probably make studying my hobby though. Do you have any other hobbies? I enjoy writing too! Currently working on an original Drama. Romance. But not in the cheesy way. I try to make it as realistic and un corny as possibile.
"After he started playing professionally, I saw him in a supermarket! It was pretty weird, though. I didn't talk to him, though I just wasn't sure what to say. And I felt kinda awful drawing attention to him lol Yeah, or at least I thought it was him. Legendary career he had That's a nice area to be. Where did your family live? That's fair, nothing worse that strife with people. How's the workforce there?"
Yeah so do I. I work as a truck driver and my back aches all the time. When did they start? That's a bummer... I love to travel but I try not to do long car rides because of my back What's your favorite place in the world? Haha I hear you! I've never been there.. have you? You like danger?
"It's a tall wooden chair, to match my tall frame. Very well built, just like me... You can borrow my chair if you want. What games do you like to play? I'm more of a Tetris man myself. I play it sometimes in the laboratory when I'm on break.  I can make you some Bravery Pills in the lab. I'm a scientist you know. Hopefully not. That sounds like a fun game you can design someday. Only if I can wear my white coat and safety goggles."
"It's a mater of perspective, I think. I'm just so busy with school, I couldn't imagine being tied to a single person. I see your point. But what do you do for work? Without enough free time, I imagine it's very difficult to spend time on a marriage. Well, good on you for remaining loyal. If I were in your position, I don't think I'd be able to. That's why I just focus on school and community theater. Yes, I don't really have any free time for a relationship. Do you keep yourself busy with any hobbies? I do stage acting at the local community college sometimes, but most of the time I act as a stagehand. It's a lot of work, but it's not nearly as stressful as medical school, so it's a relief to me."
"I read an interesting article about bikes, I love riding my bike. Usually mountain bikes, sometimes I bring my three dogs along for the ride. How about you/ Oh do you have any pets? I also have a cat. What kind of dog? Cute! I do sometimes, do you/ That's interesting what is your job title?"
"Do you think they should start putting an extra tax on it? That's fair. I think adults should be able to do what they want. My three kids drink it too much though lol Same here, my doctor told me I have high cholesterol  Not too much, they're really expensive. The kids are old enough to use their allowance money on them if they want I like horror and comedy films. Kids can't really stand horror haha Pixar films are amazing. I think it's the only thing my kids and I can agree on!"
Nice. What's your favorite kind? So you don't eat meat? Ah! so do I. Could really use one right now haha yes! I'd change that to a mashed potato though! Oh brilliant! I haven't tried a proper baked potato in a while. Sounds yum! oh i'm super hungry now! Do you heat it for around 6 - 7 minutes in the microwave?
Oh man me too! I'd rather be home relaxing and reading. What would you do? Oh I haven't done that in awhile. I miss days like those Aw :) I do- but unfortunately they are so different from me and I just can't trust them so I don't hang out with them. Well I am a caregiver for someone with a severe mental illness...and I also have fibro and work a lot- So it makes it hard to have any friends honestly. I find a lot of people with illnesses of the brain do similar things. They get very aggressive. TBI here too Was your grandma mean or nice during it? Yes they do a lot! Alzheimers...not as much. But they do with dementia often and TBI's. 
"Everything in moderation!  Lots of things can interfere with my epilepsy.  I have to be careful. I went to the Y this morning for a swim and I saw Larry King.  Can you believe that? Yes, we had a long talk about politics of all things.  I love to swim, how about you? Good, you should come join me for a dip one morning, maybe we'll bump into Larry, again. Lol The one right off Broadway next to the Starbucks. Sounds like a date! Lol"
"nice, that sounds like fun my wife is pregnant, and one day i hope to work on cars with her, i can't wait to experience bonding like you do thank you, i'm admiring you doing that with your daughters myself yes, that's right, i can't wait though! how many daughters do you have?"
"I work in a flower store. Where do you work? That's very interesting. Do you have any children? I love children. I have one of my own. A boy. He's 12 and loves to play baseball. Do you enjoy watching baseball? He's not on a team at school, but he plays on a competitive team. Do you enjoy watching any sports? That's a good question. I'm not sure who enjoys it more. I probably enjoy watching him more, truth be told. It really is something. I never thought I would have children. I didn't want to give up my free/me time, but i'm so glad i did."
"Agreed, that's why I drive a car. Do you have a moped? I work at a bar and most of the patrons are getting them now. Paying less on gas seems great! Yeah, for real!  Just tell them you're vegetarian. I'm actually vegetarian, but it's a great ice breaker No problem, sometimes it's hard to make eye contact Yeah, that helps too. Anything that gets you more relaxed is a huge plus"
Probably look into getting it fixed.
"You don't need them anyway. This will teach you to be self reliant. True but honestly we only have ourselves in this world. It's hard to find those who we trust or who care for us really If you even have one- you are incredibly lucky!  No not fully yet but I am working on it. I am in business school What are you majoring in? Business is tough but it's probably one of the best degrees to get, honestly."
"Ahaha, it makes me nervous to think about. I have some pretty severe anxiety, so childbirth worries me to death. Yes, my husband is an engineer, so I know we'll be well taken care of. Yes, I am truly blessed. What kind of job do you have? Wow, that sound difficult. Does it consume a lot of your time? Ah, I hope you're able to. I think work should always come second to family, so I hope you get enough time with them. Do you have any hobbies that have helped you stay healthy during the pregnancy?"
"Nice! Henry Ford is an inspiration Is that so? I remember Ford selling their Aston Martin shares in 2007 Aha! I would say that I love my Ferrari but eh, too broke to own one yet. Oh Enzo! Wow! that sounds amazing. I hope i could save up like you Well true, but its not like i earn much lately Fingers crossed. But  truly I need to find a way to save up and afford a mustang!"
"I love to hear them jamming out to ""Sugar"" by Adam Levine. I'm so in love with Adam, always team Adam for sure.  How about you? He's the total package for sure, but I love my two kids more. Lol You just have the one son? That's awesome, nothing like kids to make you feel young again. What do you like doing the most with your son?"
"I gave her a coloring book, but that doesn't seem to work. She is 5 years old."
"Oh lol! He is not really blues. Cake or pie? Hmm. I can go either way! Chocolate or white chocolate/ NEVER lol. But some people ;) Although I just saw how chocolate was made and it is a bit gross. Hmm..Well did you know it's from a bean? And it has to ferment which means it gets stuck in hot weather all stinky? Ohh...I guess but I do like some mushrooms. They are just a fungus. Yeah meat is bad :(  I don't do meat. Well it's not the beans themselves, just the process to extract chocolate is pretty gross."
"You think I could shoot them with my bow?  I bet I could hit them under water. Well, I like to think I'm a pretty good shot.  You don't think it would ruin the meat though, would it? Do you?  That sounds pretty rad.  I already mentioned shooting bows, but I like to remodel homes as well.  I find both to be very satisfying. Crossbows feel a bit like cheating to me - crank, aim, fire! I prefer the long bow, it requires a strong arm and a steady hand. You should, but remember to only loose the arrow when you are certain of a kill.  You don't want to injure the animal by mistake. Makes sense when you use a bow and arrow on a regular basis. Animals give their lives to feed us, so we should treat them with respect."
I go to the state university and the have student's from all over the world. You can learn alot by associating with them Never got into foreign films i am more of an outside person More of a homebody. Money is tight I hear you. Once i get my degree and a good job maybe then Hopefully my job will include traveling around Petrochemical field
"Oh okay. Figured I'd ask, because I'm near-sighted and wear contacts myself I would suppose that partial blindness is a common trait among many people these days then oh, not personally - but I've seen them on other people, close up it looks like pixelated eyes haha That should be scary for sure; are you guys going partying or trick or treating this year? That sounds awesome, should be fun scaring unsuspecting people. Speaking of haunted, the house I live in is filled with ghastly apparitions  Not really, well, maybe at first. But a person can get used to anything, given enough time"
"Yes. I would like to save my marriage if I can I suppose I will have to move out and support myself. We own a home together That's too bad. I really enjoy my job. What do you do? I work in employee benefits for an insurance broker. I wish I made more money though too The broker gets a commission from the insurance company, but I work in account management, so I do mostly HR for our groups Nope, I work with the admins for the groups. It's nice. I used to do direct HR for a school system, and that was much more stressful!"
Nice! I haven't gotten out of the house at all today. The weathers got me real bad! sigh! oh no! I hate being cooped up inside. I should atleast try and take my dog out for a walk tomorrow That's lovely! I have a park right outside my back yard. So great actually.  I hope so too. I'm already dreading winter Haha! It's actually quite cold on my end.  I love cooking and baking! I find joy in creating my own dishes!
Oh I have a lot of issues! Tons of neuropathy. Well I have serious sciatica issues that caused it to lose feeling and back problems Oh man! Did he have a ruptured disc? That is what I had I had to have surgery..and I hate surgery..and I also stretch and try to take care of myself. it can happen to anyone. Yes it hurts  Oh no. My whole foot is numb. I def can't cut it off lol True that! lol. But I am not sure if people want to hear about such gore.
"It's hard work, it makes sleeping in on the weekends so enjoyable    I would say so, it's nice to stay active. I just wish my commute wasn't an hour long. Yeah that is pretty fortunate. Does your shop sell vinyl?  Wow that's interesting I would've thought CD's would still be popular. I still enjoy listening to CD's on my commute So true, vinyl creates a nice atmosphere that CD's or streaming can't really replicate  It's crazy how vinyl has stood the test of time unlike so many other forms of medias and technologies, especially in this day and age"
"we will just see a lot of different things, lots of sites yup, this will be the first time out of the country for me, gonna be awesome well that sounds like a very relaxing time! how long have you had your pet lizard? so the color of the cage is why you got the lizard?? i have a dog yes! its a mix breed, part pomeranian part shih tzu"
"yea making clothes is always really fun yea being environmental friendly is great for everyone involved and you can make some really nice things. what all do you like to sew? oh you have red hair! i bet thats cute :D i just have natural dark brown hair haha yea ofc, red hair is eye catching for sure. do you have any animals? i have a cat yes, and a doggy mickey and mousey haha"
"yes, a pit pull and terrier mix. what's your dog's name? I love my dog as well. She reminds me much of my old dog. They both love to love people. I don't have any currently, however, i used to years ago. we found her and adopted her. They are the most underrated dogs. They are so sweet and outgoing. My dog only wants to protect me. Pit pulls are gentle giants. You're so brave. Not to be rude, but service dogs could be a big help with that."
"I pray to God that is so, I live in Texas which has a great health care system that I love. I surely appreciate it, thank you brother.  Nice to have a friend when you are in need. Not as much as I like, sometimes I treat myself to some pudding - but I pay for it later, it makes me so gassy! Haha, I can only imagine!  That's one thing I love about living here in Texas, a pudding shop on every corner! Oh yeah, pudding shops everywhere.  Fills me up, but then I put-put-put wherever I go.  It's a vicious cycle. Haha, only if there was a gas making contest!  I wish I had the talent to make it myself, but not as good as what's in the shops."
"I had no idea. I enjoy hunting myself. I also enjoying riding my mountain bike when I go camping. Do you enjoying camping? Thats cool, what do you do for a living? I'm a comic book artist. A jack of all trades I see. I would like to see some of your work Yes, I use a wacom for the rough sketches. Then, I use editing tools for the finished product. Yes, Photoshop and a few other tools"
That sounds very smart! So do you work as a performer? That is so awesome! Do any of them ever get back or nerve issues? I have when I exercise a lot. I know right?I would love to bottle their energy! I love the cirque de soliel. I am actually kind of scared of clowns so I am not sure how I am one! Yes in did work as a clown! Just go to the ones without animals please :) They are kind of abused.
"i would love to film the shops and the people. i film animals too and scenery, but never anything violent. Not yet but i would be ready to film it! He is almost tall enough. don't know, tall enough to get on without help No that's way too tall. lol. like 3 feet"
Yes. I lost my mother in an airplane accident when i was just a child. I was only 5  I really didn't want to but i had to attend a meeting for work. I would rather have gone by bus] No i took the redeye Years ago. Pretty awesome Yea but it's not the same as in person
"I've thought about it, but I'm just not assertive like that, you know? He's older than me and I get intimidated. You don't believe in love? That seems kinda sad. Why not? Have you ever thought you were in love? Well, call me naive, I know I'm still pretty young, but I think it's got to be more than that.  Wow, that's awesome! I'm going to university in the fall and still thinking about a major and considering a career as a writer. How did you start? LOL I guess that's as good a way as any! Was it as easy as you expected?"
"How much longer do you have to keep them on? I like to read, play with my dogs, or watch Netflix I have been to a couple! What part do you live in? Is it pretty there? I've only been to the east coast That sounds nice. I recently moved to Tennessee, so I am hoping to get to the west coast soon I live near the Smokey Mountains, so that's pretty and fun to explore. There's also a lot of music, farms/orchards, breweries, and some dams/rivers"
Hello. How are you today? OMG! I am so sorry to hear that. Back pain is the worst. Are you getting lots of rest and seeing a doctor? Awww. That is the pits. When my back aches I don't want to move at all. Hope doc is right. I totally know what you mean. I suffer from backaches too...nothing like herniated discs though. It's the worst. Usually when I miss a few days of working out and then go back. It's like I overdo or something.  We are too young for this kind of pain. I'm going to see Pearl Jam next week so I guess that means I won't exercise:)
"especially with the mashed potato its amazing yeah their service i amazing! they also have a free shipping option for orders over $250 ya for sure their meatballs are amazing thats cool i also have a lamp from there! BTW have you ever tried their coffee its fantastic, especially after my karate lessons. mmmmmm its amazing ya you have to try it  they are probably videos that will help. and i also believe you can ask workers to come to your house and assemble your furniture, as they are cooperating with IKEA"
"That's cool.  I'm sorry to hear that. lol, those days happen to the best of us. Do you have any pets? ah gotcha. i have dogs.  two german shepherds  They are big, but sweet haha"

"I also love that I live so close to work. I can walk there! In my free time, I like to play soccer.  Cool! Do you play it often? Yeah, I know what you mean. I wish I had more free time as well.  You are very lucky to enjoy what you do. I don't like my job very much at the factory, but at least it's close to home! It's okay, it pays the bills. I wish i could play more soccer though. "
"I live on Lake Oconee in a cabin. Where do you live? I grew up in the city, that's why I'm loving the cabin. Are you a police officer in Detroit? I'm retired now but I was a school teacher for 40 years. I loved teaching junior high kids. Grandkids are a breeze now! Do you have any children? Congratulations to you both! We had a girl and a boy. I think girls are easier to be honest. Do you know what if it's a boy or a girl? I remember those old wives tales. Sometimes they come true. Is the nursery ready?

It sure is, but your wallet suffers for it, I bet. Though, I shouldn't talk you out of it...I want to open a restaurant someday. I haven't fully decided yet, but I'm thinking maybe Latino food, some kind of fusion maybe They're one of my faves too. Do you look for the authentic stuff, or are you a fast-food taco kinda person?

I've never been there. What's it like?"

That's fascinating. I believe in the spaghetti monster. Worshipping is great. We get to eat a lot of pasta for communion. Nope. Mostly I'm a cracker with a little Native American mixed in. How about you? Very white and kinda salty. :) I wish I lived in Canada. It's been crazy hot where I live. It's just now starting to cool off.

We don't get much snow where I live but on the rare chance it does, it's beautiful."
"That's okay. I didn't like her much anyway. There are plenty of clowns at my circus to choose from. I do work in a circus! I'm a clown! What do you do? I'm surprised we haven't met before! My mom was a teacher at the clown college where I studied. I am on the east coast, well closer than the west anyway. The circus where I work parks in Florida for the winter.

"I like to keep up with fashion, you know, keep up with the latest style. Sometimes it feels like a full time job but it's worth it! You? Well, I suppose, though I aim for a higher class look, myself. My sister in law really likes her music still. Ice cream is delicious. I went to this exclusive gelato shop in Ottawa once - the company only has one north american location. it was divine! haha only in the summertime! "
"I haven't done weights much since the divorce, and taking care of my grandmother takes up so much time. Dancing!  My ex and I used to dance . . . I wish I could find someone who would like to dance with me again. That's what my grandmother says, she's getting so old and frail.  She has a hard time taking care of herself since my grandfather died. I'm sorry to hear about your loss.  My grandfather died about a decade ago, and my grandmother has been on a steady decline since. It's true - she has a lot of plant knowledge.  Uses the bark from birch trees to help with her arthritis. They all seem to die if I'm the only one to take care of them haha.  Do you have a favourite plant?"
"I feel like I haven't prepared properly for my test tomorrow Alot of my friends have suggested to study in the library as the work there tends to be more productive, however I usually don't have time because of my job I just can't wait to get it over with so I can get my free time back; I miss being able to read books in my spare time!"
"My boyfriend cheated on me again! You bet I did!  I have to go join my troop this weekend anyway It should be a welcome change of pace oh I bet, how is she? That's wonderful, I hope mine gets there soon She better, I like my Passat, and I don't want to have to change just for her, but it isn't really feasible to cart her around in it"
"How unusual, to have a last name for your first name and a first name for your last LOL No, oddly enough, I teach yoga with a last name like mine I'm fluent in yoga. I teach it. Great! So was my mom for decades. Do you like old movies? I sure do. Titanic was awesome. I do, too! Do you have a favorite band? I like Pink Floyd"
"Small world, I have a lizard name nagini!! Thats amazing, i like the kind that can grow their tails back I dunno, I think a lot of people just self publish Nope, none on lizards. Ive been on a pirate kick lately nothing too exciting, just something to turn my brain off before i walk my dog! his name is jasper, hes a bulldog shitzhu mix"
"Math can be hard, just find a way to make it seem easier.  I'm good at math and sports.  Don't be fearful, find a way to make it fun.  Oh, you can make it into a song with cool lyrics to help you remember the formulas.  Change your views and your apprehension will disappear.  I have a great memory, probably because I read a lot. "

Frustrated at work.  My job isn't leading me where I want to go professionally. OH wow!  That's awful.  Did you ever find the owner of the car? Well I hope the car wasn't a blue one - then it might have been me!?  LOL - Just joking.  Sorry about your parents.  That's kind of funny actually.  How long have your parents been divorced? That's definitely a good plan.  I just finished my MBA degree.  I think I need to put that to use and find a new job. Something in marketing or advertising. 
"That sounds like my fave! I didn't know it was called the world's first novel. Cool! Yes, I do. Especially books on pet care BC I am a pet sitter. What do you do? Fascinating! What's your favorite part about your job?"
"I think lust at first sight exists. Maybe not love I suppose. The emotions change over time though. Love lasts longer than lust. Oh yeah! Definitely! Haha! Maybe. I'm not sure. I sometimes think I'm too shallow to REALLY love someone. Haha, I'd drink to that! vodka soda water! yours?"
"Yes, I love peaceful places because my children are a handful.  Kids are fun. My sons are 1 and 4. Do you have kids? Take you time, no need to rush. But I'm glad having your own family is in your plans.  Everybody loves pizza, I have to get it with extra cheese! Right, it isn't the healthiest, but amongst the tastiest. I like it with everything on it!  Beer is great to wash anything down, especially chicken!"
"i was contemplating on running away i design video games, and im kind of burnt out on it , thats why i wanted to run away lol is ford your favorite automobile? 5'7 you? short people are better!  whats your job?"
"Oh, that's cool. What do you do for exercise? I love to go running. It really gets the blood pumping. It's not so good on my knees though.. Not serious, but they do get sore now and then. Thanks for your concern. Do you watch much TV? I love a lot of shows, but one of my favourites is Face Off. How about you? I do like to bake, I'm not very good at it though. Are you a good cook? I love spaghetti bolognaise. How about yours?"
"I would like to write a mystery novel.  Really? That's cool! Do you have a favorite author in the mystery genre? Classic! I am a fan as well! My favorite author in that genre is Agatha Christie. I honestly like them all, but I particularly like the Miss Marple series. No, but I love music though. What type of songs do you like? That's awesome! Disney does produce some great songs. What's your favorite one right now?"

The Lizard's name is Lizzie, and she's a  . . . what did they call it?  Oh yeah, a Komodo Dragon! Why would I do that? She's about six feet long now! I bring her the leftover hamburgers from work that they can't sell. Yeah, me too.  I was actually joking about the Komodo Dragon, she's actually just an Iguana.  But she is getting big! If you do I can give you a discount!  Is it okay to feed Iguana's hamburgers?"
"i dont have enough money to move out of my parents house they all have significant others....dont want to inconvenience anyone not at all, we all crave attention with all the technology we're surrounded by i miss the good ol days when things were much simpler Oh without a doubt.....no comparison whatsoever  I feel like I'm starting to sound like my parents....i think i'm just getting old"
"It's a nice path.  They put asphalt down a few years ago. Yes!  It's about 3.5 miles long, so it's a nice trek for a Sunday. It is.  I'd prefer to go to the beach, but that's only if I have a whole day available. What do you love about the beach? It's the perfect summer vacation.  We go every year for about 2 weeks. How far is a trip to the beach for you?"
"Looking to move to your own place soon? Nothing better than your own place.  Even renting for a while is a plus. If you get the right place, with good management, it's like owning your on home.   With a house, you might be able to have a nice patio with a big grill.  Great for eating healthy during the summer. Yep!  Along with some fresh veggies and a good beer.   What"
"You should definitely give it a listen, he's fantastic! A little old school for some, but it's right up my alley. My roommate and I enjoy it greatly. What other sorts of music do you enjoy? Me too! Got any particular favorite country act(s)? Garth! Yes!!! Callin' Baton Rouge is a personal favorite. That and The Thunder Rolls More than once! He puts on an absolutely fantastic show. He and George Strait are my favorite shows, hands down. Singing to out loud now....my roommate will just have to get over it! They're not a country fan whatsoever, can you imagine?!?!"
"They need more than 1 person can give.  It just didn't seem like enough. That's good, blankets are a big help, though clothes moreso. They were very common around college, so I think it's always been this way. I've noticed that.  We are surrounded by propaganda constantly.  It's a lot like Brave New World. hah, I was just reading an article on that.  Some company trademarked ""Fake News,"" you might get sued for saying that ;) Don't give them too many ideas, someone might try :)   Propaganda, after all..."
"It's honestly fairly large, way too big for me. Was an impulse buy. The cleaning alone is a nightmare. A poor purchase, in hindsight."
"I assume it should be! Well I guess that answers your question! Sorry I'm a little busy, I'm cooking a pie as we speak! Why did she leave you? That's very sad! My ex-wife cut my pinky toe with my razor-sharp kitchen knife before leaving me out of the blue, I believe I can understand your pain She didn't like my stew! She was a crazy one, I tell ya. I've been missing a pinky toe since that crazy day. Haha, I thought the opposite of that! I haven't made a single stew since then, it's too dangerous I tell ya!"
"Oh that's cool. I love to dance! I am an amaetuer dancer lol. I just learn from my favorite TV show, Dancing With The Stars. I'm trying to be. I learn as I go. No actually. I live on campus at Michigan State University.  Yea. Do you go to school? Ah ok. I love the freedom of not living with mine."
"I like taking selfies showing off my strength, but I'm not sure they qualify as ""clips"" Well, not professionally.  I just enjoy it a lot Agreed, just like traveling.  ""No one has a right to be an amateur in the matter of physical training"" as Socrates said. No argument here.  Strength is one thing, but I'm not giving up my salt, sugar, and fat. Hmm, a milkshake sounds really good right now :) Floats are hit or miss to me.  Can't go wrong with root beer and vanilla but there's a lot of strange combinations people have dreamed up."
"Yeah, training is a super nice market here. Lots of money to be made. How many times have you been to Vegas? Or have you just gambled outside of Vegas? It's a super nice place. It's way more than just Casinos. Lots of nice scenery in my opinion. Oh they're so much fun. I've never actually been to a live magic show. Just seen stuff on TV. I very much agree. There's also just such a nice rotating slot of concerts. I've heard Brittney Spears' show in Vegas was legendary. Well I've lived here for several years now, but before I had made a trip up here once for a Bachelor's Party."
Really? how tall are you?> Wow you are pretty tall. That always ok though. What do you like to do for fun? Yes i have. Only to a few countries in the bahamas though. I like trying to go to the movies once for twice a month though I have way too many to count. How ever Castaway is a great movie. I love Tom Hanks in that film. Ok. Maybe I could go with Forest Gump as my favorite. Or a very close to favorite atleast. I am a bartender in a high end steak house. How about you?
i have a cat and my girlfriend lives with me but she is away at work a lot no I want to get a dog but they require too much attention. Do you have any pets? where do you work? i am a paramedic at an oil refinery yes I have worked 88 hours this week. Looking forward to my day off. And you? very nice. I like to ski as well. Are there any good hills near you?
"It definitely helped me. I got a massive new calculator which also made me happy as I love gadgets Nothing wrong with geting one. It definitelye saved me. Math and science for sure. It also gave me time to draw after I got a tutor which was a hobby I love Ah, nice. I have no hai, but yes. I love drawing. ainly comic type stuff. Oh it's by choice. I keep it super short. This is true. Luckily, haven't had that problem yet"

It is very boring though. I sit in an office for 14 hours and might have to respond to one medical call it is very rewarding helping people that are in distress
"I'm going to my birthplace meet family I haven't seen in a long time. Well, I haven't seen them in so long I don't know exactly how things will play out. It was, but I have irrational fears. For example I'm vegetarian now and I don't know how they'll take it."
I don't know too much about basket ball. what kind of music do you like though? I like rock a lot. I also like electronic music. I have. I went to family values Korn concert multiple times when it has been in my area. How was that? I wouldn't mind going to one of their concerts. If you won the lottery you could move where ever you want. I would love to win the lottery. I wouldn't nee much expensive. I would be set for a while. However i would get a really nice house.
i do not follow soccer. I only watch hockey you should. Where are you from? soccer is more about strategy. Hockey is based on speed and skill sounds like you will be. Messi is my favorite player. Who is yours? i agree. He could have played much better and been more professional neither did team canada yes i am :)
"why are you not? Yes, I am ! be open about yourself and try to learn about them too Unfortunately, we were not together before that Texas. How about you? How's the weather there now?"
"I like Italian food a lot. I also love a good steak with some potatoes and asparagus. When it comes to salads......I'm more of a Caesar salad type of guy. A chicken Caesar salad is one of my favorites. I also like lighter dressings, not a fan of Ranch and Bleu Cheese. I'm simply not a fan of creamy dressings. I will get a light Italian or a Vinaigrette if I'm eating a traditional tossed salad. Most folks love Ranch. Not really, I'm in my 40's and into politics and earn a good salary and like to hang out with my 2 pit bulls. My dogs are actually sweethearts."
"I am at work also for an internet provider. I'll be going to the gym after. I don't have to leave home, and it's quiet so great.  Exactly, allows moe time as well in each day as I like to look presentable always, so makeup time etc. Is that a hoby? I actually did some robotics classes in college That could definitely be fun"
It's very naughty dog

"Well my dad is a preacher, so you can imagine how he responded. Right now, I just live with my parents in the country. I love just hanging with my friends and going to church. What about you? That sounds fun! Are you a fan of any other sports? I'm really into basketball and the NBA! Since I'm from the country, I gotta stay loyal to my San Antonio Spurs."

What cars do you like? That is not a bad car for the price. how long have you had it? Really? if that trange noise is the sounds in Africe i think that would be alright. Love the band Toto. what kind of music do you like? Chill is nice. I go biking a lot and that is the best kind of music to listen to for that. I have a canondale. It is great. Before that i had a fuji traverse.

Have you ever done any hard time? Wow I hope you taught him a lesson. Never mess with another mans burrito  Its a good thing I wasnt there. That guy would be six feet under if you catch my drift. well at least theres that. I hope he choked on that burrito
"That's a crazy job! I haven't been in the ER in ages. Sorry I said I HAVEN'T been! I accredit it to my love of vegetables. I'm a vegan so I stay away from any animal products. It has caused a lot of conflict with my family. Think of doing things gradually rather than having everything cut out. You can do anything you set your mind to. My favorite meal is probably some Tofu Chicken Salad with almond nuts. How about you? I am vegan, it's faux 'chicken' made from tofu. They cook it a special way to give it a unique texture."
i go there and ask why are you cutting down the trees? they say something like it disturbing me fighting with siblings will be happening in every home i have only 2 siblings yeah really they are close to my heart
Wow you are really lucky.I enjoy doing beadwork Thats reaaly cool do you sing while go hunting or are more of shower singer? it must be really cool to sing beatifully and do it in the church I also love to write my own patterns I have been getting better over the years.Its a matter of discipline I have to think about.I do it really because I love it

I'll add it to the list of suggestions my grandkids have given me! Any other music recommendations? I love me some country! Blake Shelton is one of my favorites.

I think people disrespect it for fun. I can't do olives. Too weird of a flavor for me. I do like spinach on pizza though. Pizza is an art form really. This is very true. You sound like a philosopher.

"You and me both...there's no laws when you're drinking them claws! That's a shame, honestly. It's always such a pleasant experience getting to do some tailgaiting on foreign soil. Never know who's going to destroy a folding table. If that's your life ambition is to have the ultimate tailgating experience, then travel is a must. I recommend Baton Rouge, definitely. And Buffalo, apparently. Of course! Have you got any favorite towns to recommend? I enjoy singing a great deal. Mostly in the shower, rarealy among others. It takes a great deal of courage, I have to admit!"

There's another runner that I race sometimes.  I'm pretty fast so I usually win. OK, that sounds great.  i'll bring along a pair of our newest athletic shoes for you."
"Did you know that they will hide almost anywhere...light fixtures, electrical outlets, and they're so small! Snakes....yikes! Wouldnt want to be caught dead within 100 miles of one, let alone a few feet. Hard pass! Hah! Everytime I think of ""boa"", I'm reminded of the flowery thing that the flapper-type women wore around their necks in the 1930's. They certainly had their heyday....and let's be honest, I would much rather those than an ACTUALY boa around my neck. The scales, the sliminess, the crawling....nope. Not having any of it! Even when I'm riding my bike, one crosses my path and I'm gone! Perhaps they're a bit over the top and extreme, but it's nice to know that someone else shares my sentiments."
"I do weightlifting. But, I actually prefer calisthenics.  Do you have a favorite exercise? Nice! I would say my favorite is Bur-pees.  300 is the most I have lifted. How about you?

"Drinking is great. I also love to bake cakes. It's my favorite pastime.  That's funny. I don't like thinking much either. Luckily, I just started a new job at an advertising agency so I mostly just think about work stuff right now.  What do you like to drink the most? I tend to think about sad stuff when I drink a lot. Have you had that experience? I suppose I haven't been doing it properly then. You must have been drinking a long time because you seem very experienced.  Wow, those meetings sound so uplifting. "
"Oh, I suppose it'll be alright. I'm sure there's another lab out there somewhere who will hire me. Family seems to be taking it well, for now. I may just have to take you up on that. The last time we went, it was almost a surreal experience, I enjoyed it greatly! The library? I hadnt considered that possiblity. Are the hours okay? And I'm sure the atmosphere is akin to bird-watching....peaceful. I sure hope not. I have enough savings for a month....maybe two. Then, I'm in trouble. Very much so....especially with a family of 5. Every penny goes to the dinner table or the house note, so it seems. It's nice to know that someone else understands my plight. Half the time, the money is gone before I ever get a chance to earn it."
"Yes.  Actually, I did finally conceive and she just graduated from high school.   Yes.  I was really nervous when she started driving.  I've had two crashes and it scares me. Well, I try to walk as much as possible anyway.  It helps me stay fit for softball. Isn't it great in the morning to get out of the house and feel the sun and cool air? My daughter joins me, since she plays softball also.  I'm so glad we didn't give up on having children. Hope it works out. Having kids is much easier with teamwork."
"Either that,  or they just don't care. I sometimes wonder what it would be like. Being rich with no cares in the world. Only worried about what shoes to wear that day....  I just wonder if that is why they are so cold, emotionally. Is it because they don't have to care about anything else? I suppose that money would fill a void. I think if I had to choose, I'd be comfortable, not wealthy. That is absolutely true! I hate that money, fame, and material things change people. Stuff dictates the world. This is true. I just hate seeing some of them who have enough money to make a difference, but not the humanity to do it."
ha ha. My daughter just entered college. Im right behind you. Thats amazing. Its never to late you know. I agree. I graduated when i was 28 so i know what you mean. I went to UH. University of Houston. Oh thats cool. Really hot down here most of the time though. Where do you reside now? I still live in Texas. About an hour out of Houston. 
"I'm actually looking to go there now that I've graduated college. That would be nice, but I never considered moving there. Oh what kind of shop is it? Oh that's neat. How big do they get? Oh okay so they vary a lot. I graduated with a degree in computer science actually."

"Yeah, I've been feeling lonely lately, but it has helped a lot. Sorry about that, I hope things get better for you. Do you have any plans for the next few days? That's cool. I was hoping to go job hunting, do you know if anyone is hiring right now?"
"why are you taking the medicine again? Has something been bothering you lately? Well in that case, I am glad to hear the medicine is working. Which is understandable. Have you tried natural practices, like meditation?"
"I'm the same way! That's my favorite thing to do on summer break! I love summer concert time! Country! I don't get to go to many with the way college is. This newest internship is killing me! Yeah, me too. I keep telling myself that it's all gonna be worth it when I finally walk across the stage with my doctorate! I do tennis on occasion. I haven't golfed in a long time! We need to catch up one day and play a couple holes together! Ah, same old same old. I'm back on 16 hour rounds at the hospital. We'd been doing 12 on, 12 off, but this week it switched. I've gotten used to basically sleeping while I'm standing up. How have you been?"
I plan to see them in concert when they come to town. Do they do a laser show or anything spectacular like that? It helps me in my work to stay up on the underground groups.  I get a better grip on teen mindsets. I'm a school psychologist.  So I have to be aware of their outside influences.  
"Im an okay cook. Far from a professional though. An instrument? Lol. I dont know how to play any instrument. True but i think im a pass on learning that lol. I do yes, you? Ive een it too. It is a very good movie. A movie call ""Pay It Forward"". Have you seen it?"

I love live music but don't usually have the time to go to as many concerts as I would like. that would be cool. we have a great group of guys this year. We are traveling to Las Vegas in a few weeks for a tourney. a bit of both - going to play to win of course but what fun is Vegas without some down time?  ha! I'll try to do that. LOL
I had to put quite a lot of work into studying. but it was worth it I study better at night. I seem to have my most motivation and clear thinking thne I tend to become distracted during the day. Too many things happening. do you work better during the day?
"Yeah. What are some of your hobbies? Really? Wow. Thats great. What type of league is it? I see. Well i bet it will be fun anyways. Yes. Many of them. Some pay good money too if you win. Yes, its much more interesting then it seems. Ive done that too. Its very fun and definitely a thrill."
"Thats really good. I would like country music to be played at my wedding I'm not sure, i will have to ask my fiance, although i haven't proposed yet sounds like a great book. I will have to have a look in the library Thats a good choice, didnt Whitney Houston sing that too? I remember that song, was a classic ah yes i couldnt envisage who sang it"
"I like toppings on my pizza.......all kinds of toppings, except pineapple and anchovies which don't belong on pizza. I am with you 100%, am a meme maker myself, made the dumbest meme series in the history of the modern world. It truly puzzled individuals. I did around 40 in my ""Purple Potato, Rustled Jimmies"" series, want to put them all on a poster so people can stare and WTF? That's the idea, Facebook shut me down because my work focuses on clowning about them. I also spoke very loudly. 30 days on the reg......and I'm a male transitioned to female at the age of 17, yeah, not on social media any longer. That's why I do comedy, love ya', You have to laugh at our society of hysterics. Don't Tread on Me because I ain't gonna tread on you. "

I just got divorced like joining the theater! Did your parents do anything crazy (like buying a dream car) after the divorce? really?  I'd love to buy a corvette! Do you have one? Jealous!  Nothing that nice yet...
"Maybe you left food in it. Have you tried leaving food on another part of the camp ground to distract them?  If you can't get your tent back, you could stay with me and my family if you want. We have an RV. No, it's fine, I don't mind helping out. I have my young kids staying, would that be an issue for you? My wife is into it, but I've never tried it before. I play a lot of basketball, do you think it would help me? Yeah, maybe I should try it. Who else do you have staying with you? Yeah! It's why we came here, too. It's pretty out of the way, but the nature here is great. It's too bad there are so many bears."
"yeah i wonder if this vegan thing will ever catch on Even Mcdonalds now has a burger made of veggies you should get outside more, the real world is outside and the internet is a strange place ever been in a fist fight? i used to fight people in hockey all the time yeah but now im a vegan"

"I babysit for my next door neighbor, she loves yellow. We have that in common. Yellow and black are the best combination of colors. Beige and brown are too similar. Yellow and black just look good together. red, white and blue Exactly, I wear yellow and black and fly red, white and blue......the best combinations. I just wear colors that represent what I stand for and they happen to stand for great things."
i typically don't have many vegetables in my house. No one eats them well we are vegetarian but no one cooks - we eat out quite a bit. No sense buying food if its going to go bad right? i love things like eggplant lasagna. 
"it can definitely be bad to hold yourself to one standards without maintaining some flexibility yep. my daughter holds herself to a very high standard and just graduated top of her class, but i worry that she's too obsessive about grades yeah, she says that at university she is going to try some extracurricular stuff to try and branch out from just grades i met my wife through extracurricular activities and now we work together, so doing stuff outside of class can even be good for a career what kind of work do you do? we run an NGO that specializes in integration for refugees and asylum seekers"

"Yes, there's a big ""awareness"" now about student loans. I'm not far from them.  I'm a full-time student in a major I'm not sure about. Computer science but I don't want to end up like my mom working a deadend job intelco. Yep. But I really want to play music.  Tough to make a living doing that. What do you do?

"lately not really, i'm currently a student at michigan state and i get feelings of imposter syndrome quite often yeah it's good to have awareness of your limitations. i like watching Dancing with the Stars because it inspires me to try things outside of my comfort zone i'm studying economics and the math part makes me feel very insecure sometimes does it keep you from trying things that you would try if not for your inner critic? it's a fine line, i think a person who thinks they know than they do is more of a liability than a person who questions themselves it's true, plus being critical pushes us to be constantly improving "

Just getting away from it all for a while. i love to swim, infact I was in my college team. both actually, I live about half an hour from the ocean but also have a great local pool i use in colder weather. They are concerning.  Does your beach have life guards? My one has great ones that always advise us."
"that is very interesting to know I love to watch basketball on TV.  Yes I did, Golden State Warriors were the winners. Yes, I love to watch Football. My favorite team is the New York Jets Miami Dolphins are my biggest rival. Soccer is fun to watch too. there is alot of talent on the field."
I trust god will protect me. Have you seen that show empire?
"Nope.  Do you like TV?  I have a show that I like called Rick and Morty, it's hilarious. Just these two guys that get into all sorts of crazy situations.  The cab in Barcelona would almost be something that they would experience. Me too.  Loved that show.  I watch re-runs now and then. Do you like to read? Cool, I'm trying to write a novel now.  A fiction about a boy who helps protect the world from a alien invasion."
"indeed.  So what do you work as? wow that sounds very impressive, i just work at my local sweet shop but I am studying to become a social worker. I have always wanted to but I need to work to get through uni so my candy store helps pay the bills.  that is true.  Your work sounds very stressful, what do you do to relax? I love to read aswell, every night I curl up with a good book.  I also find exercise relaxes me, every morning I do my two mile run. yes I have a wee dog, a schnauzer called Milo who is 1.  What about you?"
"That works.  I am currently working on my masters online for teaching.   Yeah I know.  I dis not want to pursue the career of working in a bank like my father, That is true.  I think he was disappointed though.   That is true/  It my life not theirs. WHat are you studying?? I Have my B.S. In biology and education.  My masters will be in Biology."
"They are all different breeds.  They were rescued from shelters. I believe the dogs in shelters turn out to be the best animals.  Do you have any other pets? What are your hobbies? That's basically my hobbies too.  I like to watch hockey and I like to watch my grandchildren play soccer. 3 grandsons and we will have another one in March.  Not sure yet if it is a boy or a girl.  They are our world! Their parents don't allow them to have a lot of chocolate.  But when we go visit, we always take them sweets!!"
"Good, i was worried i was near my limit. Yes, i find it the best way to learn a language is to be surrounded by it. When my parents died i went to mexico to learn where they came from and i've been obsessed with traveling ever since. Oh, you must have money. I make most my money translating, not to brag but i know close to 300 languages."
"that yeah of course i do watch lot of cartoons and i've a major in geology at alabama uni, do you like it no i'm not working anywhere now, I just got graduated from alabama, how about you study hard and always have patience, that will definitely help one day. where do you live how old are you, i've a girl friend for the past 7 years, do have any yes of course, we're planning to do it on next year, would you like to come, and what is your name"
"She is homeschooled.   What grade are you in? Oh my, you're just getting started!! What is your favorite color? Black is my favorite color.  Halloween is coming up and I plan to wear a black witch's costume. What kind of music do they play? I like contemporary christian music.  I like the band Third Day.  Have you heard of them? Yes very good.  I also like Lauren Daigle.  You should listen to her."
It seems as if it is becoming more popular by the day.  The music is great but everything else club related is just not appealing to me. I have been listening so much thought it is interfering with my study time. I meant though not thought...The music really speaks to me but if I'm not careful it will be speaking on my way out of school.  I can dance to it wherever I am.  You will have to go for both of us. I am staying away from them. I didn't change the subject. I already said that I don't like the club scene but I love the music. 
"I have been working for the same place now for about 31 years and I still enjoy my job. I don't have a cat, but I have a Golden Retriever dog that is a good friend and pet. Sandy (our dog) is not a very good guard dog because he is too friendly with everyone.  He is deathly scared of storms and lightening. We have 21 horses also so Sandy gets in the fields with them but never chases them. Fortunately, we have 31 acres and most everyone in our area has horses or other livestock. I love the acreage, but it is a little difficult to keep up considering I have a full time job elsewhere."
" A cat allergy is no laughing matter. Learn more from WebMD about the causes, symptoms, and treatments of allergies to cats Yea is an affirmative vote. "

"No! An actual stick.  It was supposed to be a joke! I really didn't find it funny. They took me out for fast food later, so that made up for it.  I really like fast food. It was supposed to be a hockey stick, but they have a weird sense of humor.  Do you like hockey or any other sports? I like football, but I prefer basketball.   Who is your favorite team?"

Great game, I will sometimes play World of Warcraft, Overwatch, and Fortnite. I used to play soccer games for the N64, haha. Why do you not like Fortnite? It is a little repetitive I guess.

Do you do any art or anything like that? Oh cool, my best friend draws. Do you draw people or scenery? I wish I could draw. I can barely draw a stick figure though. You're probably right. I don't really put in any effort. Maybe I'll start practicing drawing."

I really like the old star trek sound treks.  And dont forget star wars. I did not realize there was a new one coming out.  I have seen all others in theater,  i wonder if it release for the holiday season?? That is cool. My Kids will love it.  I still remember it being neat to see the first movie of the series when it came out. I was probably no older than 10.  I was in third grade.  It was the first movie besides Star Trek the motion picture to use blue screens."
"They use other techniques too like ageing them in different types of barrels like oak or sherry. Do you have a favourite whisky? Very interesting. My favourite is Caol Ila. It's got a nice smoky, peaty taste to it. You definitely should. Do you have any pets? I have a poodle called wonwon and a cat called sofie. My dog is 4 and my cat is 8"
"I'm gonna have to go with Knock Me Down, but it's sooooooo hard to pick just one. they are my life any other bands you've been listening to recently? been listening to a lot of Beatles lately. the weird thing is my bulldog prefers them over the Chili Peppers Strawberry Fields surely ....I really don't think so. pretty sure that was in 67 haha oh was Katy Perry a member of the Beatles at one point? I would've thought she'd be a groupie"
"I prefer cookies to birthday cakes! I love white chocolate chip cookies! The ones that are soft in the middle. So what do you do as a job? Woah, that's a good job! I am a Computer Science student and I work in a bar. I am going down more of the artificial intelligence and agent based systems route."
"I think patriotism is not always easily definned. It is individual to us personally It is-- Like, community values. Loving my dog and my wife and family is just as patriotic as the next thing. Right!  LOL He is a blue nosed pitbull named Benjamin  There is a time and a place for everything. I am way past my ""cat"" time. Plus, dogs are way cooler!  I am just not a fan of their nails, mostly.  But I do love them a lot Good luck with it all! Have a great day. Gotta go to work "
I would love to try and learn more about These places so i could do some tours for people  That sounds great. Denmark seems such a nice place. it would make a change of giving tours of the same old places.  Ive only tried meatloaf from the store i work in. Is meatloaf big in Denmark? I love to learn new facts like this. Do you spend much time there? You should definitely go and stay with your Grandmother more. And see The place more  Do you stay for a long period of time? Where is the best place to stay in Denmark?
"That's great, I like to run long distances. I've only recently started endurance running, though I need to improve my diet for more energy. That makes sense.  Do you have any advice for someone just starting out? Excellent, thank you.  My first goal is to eventually run a half-marathon, then go from there. Thank you, I like to set stretch goals for myself.  Here's hoping I'm able to stick with it! Absolutely, do you have any longer term or stretch goals you're working towards?"
oh yeah they didn't damage it at all. I just told them to leave it by my door no car actually! I just take the bus to work and my classes. even to pick up my kid from daycare cars are expensive and my child and school already cost enough!
"I am glad I get to stay at home, but sometimes I miss working. The interaction with other adults and just getting time away from the home. I love that I get this time with my kids.  Everyone says, You'll miss this time! and I agree. I do get to help my husband with his business.  He owns an auto repair shop and I help him with the paperwork.   He does pretty good.  I live in Michigan and the economy here hasn't been great. It seems like a lot of people are having to take on two jobs just to make it these days."
"Yeah I watch the tv show whenever I have a chance That's great do you play the computer game or the card game? I've never played but it does look interesting. I look to cook so it takes up a lot of my time. Yes for sure! I like trying new dishes and having my friends and family be my test tasters. At home mostly, I'm tryingto save for house so I don't really eat out much. How about you, do you eat out a lot? I rarley eat lunch since my mornings are normally very busy for me. But I love food in general, I could ate all day if I couldn't gain weight."
i have a dog named percy i love him very miuc. wow yes it was i thought i had to talk first sorry. yes he do. lol how cute to see that wow. i love my dog percy. yes it is what your dog name? wow how cute why that name?
"Yes me too, Italian food is heavenly Good old spaghetti, can't be beat! I do if I have time, but I am very busy these days so true, I am almost always on the road in my car  Yes in sales. Had to get a new Chevy the other week because the old car died. What hobbies do you have? That sounds really cool. Me I like writing music"
"That's interesting! I am a cyclist myself, so maybe I need some tips on how to stay fit from a fellow athlete! Great tips thanks. So do they play for the Buffalo Bills or is that a rival team in the league?  Nice to have stuck with a team that long! I've been a Cowboys fan from birth myself. I've been close to switching teams. Ha!"
"are is nice. music especially. if you can listen to good quality, anyway :\ Do you use airpods or something like that? I'm trying to decide what my next pair of headphones should be. My current ones just broke."
"I like shrimp, but cannot eat them unfortunately.  My fingers are long and I have a hard time peeling them. I actually never have been.  I've seen them on Forest Gump though. I am not familiar with that movie.  What is it about?  My favorite movie is Good Fellas. I like to oil paint, but don't have much time for it.  I'm usually driving my kids around to their activities.  How about you? I do.  We grow tomatoes mostly, but mix in some herbs as well.  My long fingers do not impede me with gardening. Not sure.  I guess I was just born this way."
"I've always thought of adopting. Kind of skips the ""hard"" years of parenting! Not too much, just a thought that I have. My best friend down the street has adopted and they're wonderful. No, not really. What issues are you concerned with? Well, those are things you'd face with having your own children too! Just make sure you're prepared. Of course, that's one reason to adopt. To help those kids have that chance. Good luck with that, but for now definitely concentrate on school/career!"
"It really is! I plan to surprise my sister with some new plants for her garden with the money! She grows roses and any type of flowers that you can think of! Oh, that is a great idea!  I have never heard of cornflowers! Oh that's cool!  What color is your hair? That's so beautiful! That is fine!  I'll have to go visit them sometimes and see them in person."
Chocolate is my favorite flavor too but yes to gelato. I eat way too much of it when I am sad. Since my best friend moved to Japan it seems like I do this more often than not. I need to get over it.
"Is that northern or southern california? I have ridden my motorcycle through california a lot.  Lots of great bands in SoCal More into Radiohead and the like . I also like 80's punk and new wave   Yeah they've changed a lot over the years, but they're super involved in thins I care about.  Politically and socially Nice!  Absolutely.  I'm from Detroit and have listened to a fair amount of rap thorugh the years.  That genre has changed quite a bit, as well."
"Cool, you must be old like me...haha How did you get into these type of music? You must have good taste in music. I listen to investing podcasts. I like to watch tv and surf the net while drinking a glass of wine.  You? Nice, what is your favorite dish? Do you make healthy dishes?"
"I bet that is a fun time. I miss spending time with my family at times. We haven't spoken in years. After my parents passed we all just kind of drifted away and our doing our own things. My father passed away 10 years ago and my mother was around 5 years ago.  My favorite would have to have been going camping. Every summer we would got to different state parks and camp for a week. I loved it.  It was fun, I haven't been camping since. I always see post from my 4,000 friends on Facebook camping and I think I should go.  I may now that the weather is getting cooler."
They gave me a half pound of chicken instead of turkey. I didn't realize till I got home. Yeah i thought about taking it back but it was rotisserie chicken so it was really good. Turkey next time.  It sure it. What other foods do you like? sweet and sour chicken is delicious. i just had Chinese food yesterday.  my favorite thing to get when i order chinese is crab rangoons. so good. oh. my name is todd. i used to be a computer programmer but am since retired.
"I like when people put aquatic plants in the aquarium with the creatures. I have lots of houseplants, but none in an aquarium. i can imagine its a lot of work. Supporting my children, horseback riding as well. Yes. It's been wonderful watching them get comfortable around and on horses from a young age. Two boys. Can be a hand full sometimes, actually often. LOL Raising children is always a challenging. Rewarding though, at least thats what I tell myself."
"Maybe he just went into massive debt for it. Well, he does seem to have some late night trips at 3AM lol. Maybe I'll do what he's doing! I only make 30k a year and could use a new car. Folk music festivals? Sounds fun! I've only been to a few metal concerts. I'm shy too! Yes I did, it's very loud but the music and shows are always great. Marilyn Manson is really catchy! His interviews are pretty funny and witty too."
"I fear some kind of horrible accident. I paint houses for a living so I am always high up on ladders.  Possibly. I mean I like my job and it's a good living, I just constantly have this nagging fear. Maybe just paranoia.  What kind of job do you want to get when you do get a job. A part time job can be a lot of fun! Oh wow, that sounds like a lot of fun. What character would you want to be if you could wear any costume?  Stitch would be a fun one. I would want to be one of the old ones like Donald Duck. Those costumes would be hot though! Maybe they have little air conditioner units inside. I know some college mascot costumes do. "
"I love reading, I recently finished The Goldfinch. It was long but so well written. Since you enjoy Art, the Goldfinch theme of art may really be your thing! I learned a lot by reading it, the author works in info about Rembrandt and many others. I so agree!  I recently joined a book club which encourages me to read outside my normal zone. Ditto, I also read when I feel overwhelmed, it helps me relax. I do wish I had more time to indulge/read."
"Wow, you do know your stats! I didn't really like sports growing up, but in my early adulthood I really got into Football. It was very social! LOL_ I was just there for the food at first, then I learned to love the game. Got fat too! Right! Well, my husband and I just bought a camper and we're headed south, so I have no excuse not to exercise! That's true, but I have cut out a lot of bread and sweets! It's tough, but we are also going to live in the camper over the winter and there is really no storage, so I don't have junk food around me."
"yikes! which species specifically are you talking about? yeah I honestly have no idea how I stomach owning 2 myself...my friend passed them off on me! no no, I spring for the best organic snake food money can buy. the same stuff I eat basically oh well there's always time to change! what's your favorite junk food? oh well I'll be honest, sometimes when I'm at my asian market buying healthy stuff I'll grab a packet of the deluxe ramen.... my try to make your own ramen someday! there are some really good recipes online"
"Is dancing is your profession for passion Is dancing is your profession oh...what is your dance style... Sorry  I forgot,other than dancing what else you like to do the most So everything is towards  fitness Hmm..how much time you spend everyday for these."
"yes they are grown up. i make 50k a year most of the expenses are for them yeh im ok with that, i spend most of my time making clothes. i like to make clothes specially for them yeh its been like almost 8 years now right now i don't have any pages but i will make one so i can get more customers yap! its a pleasure to meet you have a wonderful time."
"I think it would be pretty cool to be your own boss. That way you could manage your own schedule. Yeah, same. And you could schedule your time off whenever you like. I like to travel so that would be a huge bonus. I live in the northern part of NY (near Syracuse) so I like going into Canada for weekend hiking trips. It's really pretty up there. Oh yeah, where is that?  I've not really spent much time in the South. I like to run so not sure how well I'd do in the heat. Very much. Though we can get a lot of snow in the winter which can be just as bad as too much heat I'd suspect."
"I agree, but I work two jobs so it's hard to find free time sometimes. I would never do that. I'm afraid of heights.  I would just stay on the ground and look at the sky. That might be pretty cool to experience.  You can try and I'll watch.  My favorite color is blue, so maybe you wear a blue diving suit. Maybe Arizona or New Mexico would be a good choice.  Lots of dessert and hot weather there. That sounds really neat.  I visited Red Rock Canyon once and thought that was beautiful. Our family went there with some friends last summer.  We stayed in Corolla, and loved it!"
"Oh I see. Did you play any sports in high school? What types of extracurriculars? I did cheerleading and had a great time with it. That sounds like a fun bunch of activities. I also enjoy shopping, do you? I really like going to the mall. What is your niece into? That sounds exciting! Kids are so fun. it was nice chatting with you. have a great day!"
"She might have troubled a lot and it's quite sad. Yes, sometimes it looks everything's fine, but you don't realize what all pain one's going through."
It can be but i have my cats to keep me company
" my favorite purse is a deep shade of red  I have never thought about that, it would be really pretty! I think it would be great for that or accent pillows! Geology? that sounds interesting what does it entail? o ok neat, have you found anything rare or valuable? wow! thats amazing. "
"What does your husband do exactly, seems like you have a lot of money? Do you have a horse? hahahaha, how long does it take? What breed do you have? i find them so cool and powerful. I want one for myself How much is saddle?"
"I'm just chatting here, but I'm keeping my eye on that ugly spider in the corner. It's pretty big.  To me it looks as big as that airplane I fly on the weekends.  I don't know how you do that.  I am so scared of those things. I bet you have lots of scary, ugly spiders in that club too! That's so funny! Thanks for giving me a laugh.  I just hope I never see a spider when I'm flying my plane. About 15 years ago, and it took me about 5 years to become certified to fly anything."
"Well, parenting is a learning curve. Some parents improve with time.  No they are not! I'm the baby of the family, youngest of four, and I was spoiled.  I became a school psychologist, maybe so I could figure out some of these things! What do you do? Oh that sounds interesting. I mostly work with children and sometimes their parents.  They are grades 1 through 6, so quite little.  Yes, I often do. The children are the easiest part of the job!"
"I loved To Kill a Mockingbird. It inspired a lot of the art I made a few years ago. I have paintings and I've made a few ceramic figurines. I haven't read that. I need some new inspirations-I'll check it out.  Sadly, or maybe not, reading and creating art make me ravenous for sushi and pizza. The bloat after:( Those are my absolute favorites. I could eat one or the other every day! Yes. Lucky you. I love in the suburbs and have to drive 40 minutes to get either. Good thing Grub Hub exists huh?"
"I am from Kentucky  My whole life, 32 years. Where are you from/  Where is Adelaide, never heard of it?  Oh that is awesome. i would love to go to Australia. My sister wants to become a missionary there. "
I didn't use a lawyer for my last divorce and kind of got taken to the cleaners. That was a big lesson. You are right. I am learning that my last name makes it easy for me to get married but hard to get divorced. I've been through 3 divorces - this will be my fourth. You'd think I would have learned by now. That's my problem. Beach bunnies:) The right one will come...I guess. I love Jamaica and Hawaii. Locally I love Nantucket and the Outer Banks. I've been to Panama City once. Great area. Maybe I'll try the slopes for wife #5.
"Me too. I keep trying to get him to volunteer with me - I think it would help him be more empathetic. I volunteer at the Red Cross on the weekends. It makes me feel really good and helpful. Oh that's wonderful! Do you enjoy it? I do yoga pretty frequently. It's made my back stop hurting almost entirely! It's great once you get started, but it takes a while to touch your nose to your knees. What's your favorite food? I second the eggs. I've got a flock of chickens, so the eggs are always fresh! I can't live without potatoes though."
"They seem to be doing  OK. I keep busy volunteering at the Red Cross. It keeps my mind off things. OH, I'm a teacher too! I sub on the high School level. Don't we know it-lol! What grade do you teach? Mostly High School AP classes. I actually have my PhD. Thank-you. I'm thinking about applying for a full time position."
"She came back home with a boyfriend! She's excited.  We're going out for sushi tonight to get to know him.  Sushi is my favorite There are so many variations!  The best I've had was in England when I went to visit my brother I have yet to try a seafood I don't like, honestly.  As long as it's not super fishy I love it all Pizza is always a good choice.  I really love a good salad with lots of different vegetables in it I make a lot at home so I can have more variety in them.  It's hard to find good ones in restaurants"
"Yes, I can't wait!  When is the last time you went to the beach? Woo nice, do you live near the beach? What kind video games do you play? Fun! I played it with my coworkers last week.  What is your favorite food? big mac mmm...I love anything with beef! Do you have any pets?"
I've been busy shopping today. What are you doing? Oh dear! How awful! Was anyone hurt? Were you robbed?  I'm glad you all are okay. Last night I heard police sirens for 2 hours straight & there was nothing on the news to say what it was. I turned a police scanner app. They were chasing an armed robber who was on foot around where I live. It was scary. Not as scary as yours tho. My dogs got pretty excited by everything and it got a little noisy in my house for a while. I let them bark in case the robber was nearby.
"I think he was just crazy for money. they were giving him $5000 to do it so you'd eat a sandwich full of spiders for $5000? I'd have to really think about that, I usually eat pretty healthy.... yeah it's my job to help people travel around the world, so maybe I could send you to a country with tiny spiders to help you stomach it been working as a travel agent for a few years now. honestly it's getting me down...hard to see people travel so much when I never do! I do! right now it's a 3% discount, but in 2 years it'll be upgraded to 5%! oh I'm thinking Kentucky"
"yeah, I am really shy but I love to sing so I decided to give it a try wow thats a great idea, I have never thought of doing that,  thanks! So what do you like to do? Oh I love hiking! I like to sing, mostly to myself and dogs, and spend time at the beach yes very true, its my favorite time of year to visit the beach since the weather isn't hot but isn't cold either, what is y0ur favorite beach? cool, I have never been there, in fact I have never been on a cruise either well i do love to travel so maybe next time i will try a cruise"
"Do you work in Art museum then what is your other interest I dont have a idea about The Voice,what is that  In which Tv channel,if i find time i will try to watch Do they really pic talented people through the program Is it like for dance or what ever talent they have can be performed"
"I like Steven Tyler. Which ones? The one from the movie.... Armageddon.  ""I dont' wanna miss a thing""? Yes. What about ""Dude looks like a lady""? It was on the Mrs. Doubtfire soundtrack. LOL me too, its hilarious. I like Robin Williams movies typically. I don't think he is Canadian?"
How many years difference for each kid Then it will be very difficult to take care of them 
Not really.  I'm not a fan of having a job.
"yes, i head the same  ye, I am feeling very well No. It is very important for me to do exercise Exercises and interacting with other people help me feel better"
"yeah my discount theater is showing Pain and Gain. I'm a bodybuilder so I really love that movie! yeah it's just about weightlifters committing a crime haha. what movies do you like? what about superheroes? my favorite is the Flash, I hope he gets a movie soon! yep but I demand movies in addition to the TV show! I did actually. I thought it was pretty good, but I liked King of Comedy better (which it was heavily inspired by) yeah if you liked Joker you'll love it"
Yes. I love plays. Local theatre is a pleasure to watch. I don't usually remember the names to be honest. Or do you mean Hollywood actors? I like movies as well.  I like Robin Williams. I am goign to watch Mrs. Doubtfire today. Its very funny.  I also really enjoyed him in the Birdcage. You should watch it!   my favourite character is the one played by Hank Azaria.
"Even so I managed to spend the day without problems, I think I'm great with children haha It's true, it's really complicated to deal with that conflict. I guess everything has a stage, even the stage of loving oneself as innocent teenagers .. well that's the deal when accepting a relationship. ""Your problems are mine now"" but also the joys, you may see the good stage if you manage to endure this. Of course it can be, everything depends on oneself to some degree. Maybe creating a hobby between the two would be great. For example, I love drawing with my partner. Thank you, everything is a work in progress. Better to enjoy between times haha. I hope you can clarify your ideas friend"
That exactly how I feel. I build computers for a living and I always try to do it through the eyes of what my kids would like.  I used to e a mechanic. It's a lot easier than doing that for 6 years.  That's one of my favorite things also. What other hobbies do you have.  I don't think I could be a rock climber but I do love hiking.  That's exactly why I can't do it.  She is definitely braver than I am. I would faint and fall over the edge. 
"Captain is a really jolly guy in movies lol. Yes, I kind of liked it.  Was not that impressed. I really liked Iron man 1 and Captain Marvel Robert Downey Jr is a great actor.  Did you like any of the DC movies.  I only liked Aquaman. Everyone hates on Ben Affleck but I do not think he was that bad as Batman I loathe Christian Bale.  Any movie he is in."
"not too many right now, where it is getting colder, they have all migrated south for the winter just wild ones. I love seeing the cardinals. I have always heard if you see a cardinal it means someone from heaven is visiting you. I always see 2 okay. thanks for the reminder. How is the weather where you are from?  It's fall here, so winter will be here before we know it. I wish it was still summer. I love the heat, not humidity thought, kills my asthma I am from Kentucky. So we get all the seasons. It can be 90 degrees one day and 50 the next.  depends. we just went through a 40 day no rain spell, completely sunny, and 90...all grass was dead, i love that part no mowing/weedeating"
"I will look around and see if my public library has them I kinda remember reading something in high school about a ring  and hobbits. I hardly ever watch movies based on books not close for the most part I just finished reading a Terry Pratchett book ""men at arms"" almost all of the Terry Pratchett books are very good great characters and stories I started reading Lords and Ladies who knew the truth about horseshoes!!"
"I agree. That is so sad. We adopted our cat from a shelter. Do you have any pets? Me neither. We keep our cat strictly indoors to keep her safe, warm and dry. I may like being out in the rain, but no way she does, lol. Silly dog! So what kind of things do you enjoy doing? I love watching old movies from like the 30s and 40s. Yeah, reality TV really is trash I think. Entertainment seems to have gone downhill. Give me the classics. I love anything black and white, esp with Rita Hayworth Oh yes, Cover Girl Gilda, Affair in Trinidad. Classics. What 90s shows did you like? Friends? I loved X Files. Esp episodes with the Lone Gunmen. I love that Netflix lets us go back and revisit all those shows. What else do you do for fun?"
"I love coffee I need it 24/7 I try to go to the gym but I work with computers for a living so you would say i'm a bit of a techie I love music what about yourself?  I also like tall woman that's my second favorite thing I like a lot of Rock and Metal but will listen to other genres except for country and jazz as well no I tried guitar when I was younger but I was awful at it, what about you?"
"Who is your favourite tennis player? I like Serena Williams. It was a wild ride to watch her last match leading to her retirement. Well she was, yes. Bianca Andreescu pulled off a big win against Williams. I think it was an upset for alot of people. I think its nice to see new talent make their way up the ranks. Yes, its very interesting how the bar keeps getting higher and higer."
"oh that's cool. I don't think so. have you seen any? I have not seen any so far. Ok, do you like it? sounds cool. I think you are right."
What's even more surpising is I have crashed my CAR 2 times as well. Yes!  I don't know what I would do if I couldn't play my sports and get out for some air. I don't really read much.  Which do you prefer? Sports or reading? I've never heard of it. What is it about? I will do that if I can ever get time away from my outdoor sports. Football.  I love American Football.
My dad who is a doctor gave me his friends restored Mustang. Thanks he's the best. Wow that's awesome. Is it hard? Cool. Do you have any hobbies Really me to. I have a lot of veggies and flowers. Lol yeah Texas is the same. It was nice talking to you.
"o yes now i know who he is Did he ever speak in vegas? I want to move there The fact that it is lively 24 hours a day Thats true, if you could choose anywhere to live where would it be those sound like nice secluded places sounds great I am tired of being surrounded by neighbors lol"
"it was pretty difficult, I am a little anxious so how was your day? oh that sounds great, so you are pretty handy with cars? what sort of music do you like listening to?  I am the same, my playlist is very eclectic with a bit of everything really! Even some Creed i think! My all time favorite band is Foo Fighters Marketing and Comms. I kind of fell into it and I wouldn't say it's my passion, but we will see where it takes me..."
"What is that about? Oh wow, that sounds fascinating. And relevant to today's time. Definitely. I worry that there will be another massive war like that in the future. It's terrible that powerful people jail others just for disagreeing. My son is very outspoken about politics and it makes me concerned for him. I agree. I enjoy reading all different types of books for that reason, to get many perspectives. I agree. I hope we can see a more peaceful world in the future."
"I mostly like to stay inside and browse the internet. I love going outside in the winter though. That's cool. What do you like doing in the summer? The apartment complex I'm in doesn't allow dogs! A dog would help me get out more. What kind of dog is it? They are adorable. My parents only ever bought Boston Terriers, so I grew up around them. Lucky you! I've been stuck with the same old breed and now I cant even't get one."
"I love pancakes with syrup!   I enjoy organic maple syrup! I have to eat certain things, mostly all healthy to maintain my physical shape Yes!   I have been doing yoga in the morning to clear my mind before practice I started Yoga when I took a vacation to Bali a few years ago after the season was over. I would one day love to retire to Bali!    Every person there is so grounded and peaceful Yes!   Have you been often?"
"yes, most of the time. That is good but i can not say the same for myself. I really want to be like that, can you share me some tips? That is a good suggestions, i really appreciate it. Understand. It is a good idea to lookup to God in time of crisis."
"That's cool! I like playing football and reading. Nice! what's your favourite book? Would have to be Noam Chomsky's Manafacturing consent You should have a read. I love him. No I'm only 20, are you? Better off without the excess baggage ey. I'm sure you can do much better anyway."
yes i love to drink tea with my wife of eight years i see do you have any kids? yes 3 and i am 32 years old of course we have lots of fun as a family yup every year one of my favorite holidays sounds funny i was a pumpkin last year
"Yes, and I also have four grandchildren.  The youngest is seven, then 10, 14, and 30. :) What is your dog's name?  That is a cute name! Yes, they are close by. My youngest grandchild reads to our dog and he seems to enjoy it. We both love books.  Me too! Have you taught Doodles any tricks? My dog Wiggles can sit and stay.  Yes, he must be! That's impressive. I like to volunteer at the library. What do you enjoy in your free time? "
"It just went fine. Never expected much out of that. Sometimes, you learn great deal. However, you should never keep unrealistic expectations. I always follow that..  That's 100 percent true, validate every bit of it, never trust blindly. it may put one in trouble. I agree, almost every other information is from unverifiable source, who knows, who's frustrated mind you're read to.  I always try to consider original resources, which are reviewed thoroughly. I always suggest others to do the same.  Yeah! and another aspect to that is writer's credibility and previous publications. "
"I try to ignore the unhealthy side and just enjoy the taste Really? I always thought cutting out sugar wouldn't make a big difference. Oh wow, unfortunately I don't think I have enough self control to change my diet. But how do I get rid of the temptation at the grocery store? Well, I did just start that food delivery service. Where they deliver you healthy food to cook. Yeah, I had a discount. It seems a little expensive to keep ordering food online though."
"What are some of your favorite ingredients?  I like them as well. They are delicious in Indian dishes.  That does sound good. I will try that and take it to the hospital with me for lunch. No, not completely. I still eat meat but only a few times a week. I feel it is better for my long term health to avoid it. What about you? Was the change for health reasons or something else? "
"Yes! it's really cool i really like to play slackware Most of all because of the plot of the game, it is very entertaining! And it is! and you? But you played, right? Of course, yes, how not to play it if it is my favorite! Some of the ones I like not as much as slackware is runescape"
"He's 2, it's been a long time since I managed to go out by myself. I do too. I went for a long walk around my neighborhood, had coffee with a friend, got a book from the library, and got some McDonald's french fries. No, that was when he was with the babysitter. I wanted some time just for myself and friends. Oh, we go for walks often. But it's nice to not have to worry about him for a couple hours. I do, my family is from Japan so I sing him traditional Japanese lullabies. He seems to enjoy it, he often smiles and giggles."
He is a Congress man that was accused of making sexual comments. I'm a female and I hate him Yes he is. Its about time for breakfast. What did you eat? That sounds great. I love omelets as long as they don'y have tomatoes.  
"I was so emotional.  Do you have any children? Yes, I have always dreamed of having many.  So far just one. Maybe someday you will be ready for it.  Do you like video games? I am a big fan of Mortal Kombat.  I even love the corny movies they put out.  With Chris Lambert. did you have a favorite character? OMG that is my favorite character too!!!"
"I enjoy rock music too, but my marriage and children take up a lot of my free time. I would say my favorite is Kiss. Mine is Nowhere to Run which is fitting since I despise running. My kids hate it when I blare my 45s of Kiss. My husband walks around on Saturdays with earplugs in his ears.   He had to learn that the hard way.  LOL"
That sounds really cool! Maybe when I grow up I can be a swimmer! What do you like to do? Michael Phels is one of my heroes! Did you know he broke a world record for swimming at 15!
"What are your favorite genres in particular? What would you say is the weirdest thing you listened to? Haha, what kind of music do they listen to?"
"Tell me about you. Wow, thats really interesting. My favorite food is friend chiken. How about you? I like eating ice-cream with my sister Jessica. We are really close. How is your family? We are twins! Although she is technicaly older then me. We get along quiet well, its nice. Yes i do, mostly bikes but also enjoy riding horses"
"Channing Tatum is a wonderful actor and so nice to watch.   I saw both Magic Mike and Magic Mike the sequel. Those were great. No I normally wait for them to come out on Netflix or Prime and watch them at home.   I'm really not a movie theater person.  I like to be in my home, comfortable and watch without others bothering me. I agree that the big screen and sound quality is better at the movies, but I hate the noise from the other people.   Did you know that Channing Tatum put himself through college with the job of male stripper."
Yes! Now I have a bunch of flashlights also When I have to go and check the greenhouse at night I really like a big bright flashlight Best lights are cop lights.  The local raccoons like my tomatoes a bit too much have caught them stealing at night Anything that can chomp on a small dog in one bite would scare me too! Can you eat them? Probably taste just like chicken as the joke goes
Really don't know what to do in those situations. Any advice?  Sometimes ignoring is the best solution. I will try that. Thanks for the advice. What' s the weather like this days? Foggy and cold. Not a big fan of days like this. O really? That's cool.  Nope

I'm a secretary at a big corporation, so I just like to sing in my spare time. What do you do for work? Accounting is a really great profession. You must be really good with numbers?"
"I study business administration. I go to college part time at one of the most prestigious university in Boston. I will be graduating this year with honors Oh, wow! We're attending the same university, LOL. What did you study? Where did you hang out around the campus? What class are you? How come I never meet you? Yes, absolutely.

"Yes they are!  It's so much fun watching those races with my dog because he watches them too. Yes it is actually!  Do you have a favorite driver? I like him too, but my favorite is Denny Hamlin One year I went to a race with my Dad and i had to leave the dog home for a little bit while we were at the race.

"Fresh beats as in music, I want to make a living playing in front of an audience. Play the piano. Taught myself. How 'bout you? Do you play? No, I have not. I am actually really shy! That I do! I take my kids weekly. They love running around and playing.  That's like throwing a rock into a lake and hoping it hits something on the way down other then water! I'll keep my eyes open.

Can get a little lonely at times though. Do you live with anyone?"
"but would you say Chevrolet is a brand worth buying? yeah, anyways it is complicated to know if it is the ideal brand or not. I don't want to make a bad expense since I will soon open a business. The mini van is always the winning option in your case right? hahaha I have my options reduced to a fruit market or restaurant. Thanks, I will do my best. And how are you doing with your wife's pregnancy? oh ups, I thought you used an analogy when expressing yourself. But how does the experience feel? I still have no plans to have them. I'm glad to notice the happiness I bring you."
"I know, they are stunning. i snorkled in the Great Barrier Reef in Australia about 10 years ago. I don't remember much, we stayed in Port Douglas and took a boat out to the reef.

"Wow, I didn't know it was that much! I love to read, so I could go through a few books a week! I'm so grateful for technology. I have anxiety and i'm afraid to go out. So, it keeps me connected. Yep! I even get my therapy on line-LOL! Well, maybe. I'll have to see. I do feel like I'm making progresss. Yes, it's better than taking medication. Also, I use social media quite a bit to keep in touch with others. Ye, there are always security risks. I got my identity stolen a few years back."
"I agreed.  It also comes in so many different shades I think it would be fun.  I saw someone just yesterday who had their hair purple.   You could try putting just a few streaks in your hair.  That way if you pull it up no one would see it Just check with your boss about it, or better yet do it the month of breast cancer awareness. Well pink is, but its close enough you could get away with saying you were doing it for breast cancer I stay at home and manage my household and everyone in it.  It's more work than I ever did at my last job"
"Ah, any particular reason you're moving to London? I see, I see. A change of pace is never really a bad thing. I could use a vacation, might travel up there some day. Ahhh, a restaurant in the heart of France sounds good right now. Never thought of that, haha! Could go for a crepe myself, mmm. That's so true. Anything you're looking forward to eating often in London? I'd love to sip some brew while snacking on Fish n Chips at a pub."
"Interesting. I didn't know that. I guess I can see the connection since they both deal in the unseen.  What are the crystals supposed to do? Why do they use them?  Do they provide physical or mental healing. Or both?  I like being outside. I play a lot of sports and things, so I like the outdoors, but I dont know if I consider myself a nature lover necessarily.  I should really go on hikes more. Do you get out into nature a lot?

"I'm getting a music industry degree. What do you do? LOL! You should have taken up the tuba for spite. I had a musical family. Everybody played an instrument so it just came naturally. What's Nashville like? Alabama believe it or not, but I haven't been there in a while. I like it up north. No doubt. I think people are slow there because of that awful heat. Hottest place next to Texas I've ever been. You won't catch me denying climate change! I don't like big cities either. It's too hard to live there."
How long have you been together? Do you have it all planned out?  Where and how? Exciting! And I assume you have the ring? I remember when my husband proposed to me.   It is... never thought I'd have to get a family car like a honda Civic! It is. And good gas milege

"I saw one when I was 8, but haven't seen one since. I'd like to get the chance again. It was just a partial eclipse I think, but still very exciting. I really just like going for walks. Sometimes just walk in the woods or around town and look at things. It definitely is, it's a workout sometimes. I live on a hill. That's tough, for sure. What do you do for work? That sounds like a difficult job."
"For sure.  I actually don't have a dog though.  I have two snakes.  They're awesome. Yes, they're in glass cages, but I take them out and handle them all the time.  They're friendly! They're both pythons.  They eat rats I breed.  We're an all-organic family. Yes, rats will each just about anything.  Unfortunately for them some things eat rats, too. Indeed!  So tell me about your hobbies or interests. That's not so boring!  I love reading and riding my bike as well.  Too cold for biking right now, but perfect for reading!"

"I used to eat dry watercolors back in Kindergarten. Usually blue. That was my favorite ""flavor"". Did you have a preferred brand of paste? I was known to eat a dab of Elmers every now and then. Also ate reams and reams of paper. That sewage is what ""brings all the boys to the yard"", as they say... I cant image that it was true. 85% of kids in school will eat at least one sheet of paper this week. They cant contaminate it, can they?"
Yep! I start every morning with a cup of french vanilla. Do you like coffee?
"Yes, it's great, do you buy with coupons? It's fun to save a little with coupons Great! Barba de tres dias? Fantastic, but what brands of shoes? Hehehe, I like adidas shoes too You are right, it is a brand that has a lot to give with respect to shoes, it has a lot of variety"
I wish I can do it but maybe I have to try another sport.  I know I won't do surfing because I hate the beach. The sand and it is either too hot or too cold at the beach. What sport do you like? Oh I wish I am as tall as you. I think being tall is better than short. Oh really? I hope you won't have those issues and stay healthy. Keep doing the volleyball. I think the best exercise is the one you enjoy.
"How did you realize that you were having mental health issues? I feel stressed and ""off"" sometimes but I don't know if everyone just feels that way Doesn't everyone feel that way though? What finally made you decide to talk about it?  I think I need to build up the confidence to just do it.Who did you tell? I have a basketball coach, do you think that would be a good choice? Maybe I will try that "
"I have a little girl named Lucy. I'm a big fan of all kinds of pies. Pumpkin is my favorite. Oh me too. I actually wrote a story about cheese cake once.

The one you mention sounds great, I like chicken and mushrooms as well No, its only me at home so it feels more trouble than it is worth. DO you cook for your family? Sounds idylic! I can't rmemeber the last time I had a big Sunday dinner. True. I might just go for it this weekend and plate up the spare and freeze it. More economical probably as well."
"How expensive is the delivery though. It's great convenience, but I would hate to pay that much.  Yeah, I prefer going out and eating and maybe spending time with friends while I eat. Although that's definitely expensive too! Yeah, that can be tough. Although ordering in from Uber probably can't help too much either :/  Yeah, it can be really hard not to do. I eat out way too much.  Yeah, anytime I try to buy from the healthfood section at the store, I blow through my budget so quickly.  I completely agree. It would be nice if fast food places had a cheap healthy option on their menus in addition to the trash. "
"I work at the museum,its a great place to work you know? No, but art is a big part of life, i cherish it so much, it's like i'm stuck in a wheelchair with it.

I've gone to a few games when I was in high school. I've seen the boston bruins live twice. Close to. About 50 minutes away.  Very nice. DC is too crowded for me though. 
"I am a bit concerned about leaving my painting business for that amount of time though... You just cant find anyone reliable these days though I dont want to miss out on the income while I'm away.  Oh well, It will be worth it to get away from my kids lol I'm actively a painter, what is your profession? Oh brutal.  Must have been pretty awesome at math as a youth then I mostly do submission grappling on lunch breaks, and other than that I just hang around with my kids.  And you?"
"Well, they were really slow I suppose so. But they also spelled my name wrong twice! Not really. It's a pretty common name. That's a really good point. I should try to be more understanding. I really love to go fishing, especially fly fishing. How about you? That is what's great about fishing. People of all ages can enjoy it."
"I didn't even try. I feel ok setting my own pace and beating my own goals. I haven't yet, but I'd like to try. How about you? That sounds nice. I live in the country too, with my cat. Me too. Mine is named Seven of Nine. I like to go to Broadway shows. I love singing show tunes! Only once or twice a year, but the songs get stuck in my head constantly."
I have some sketchy neighbors that I don't like walking past.  That's a good idea!  Yes that's true. I've seen where it alerts your contact if you drop your phone which is good when you can't react quick enough Yeah that's not a bad idea. I would carry if I could right now. there's just too many unknowns. Just too many people with bad intentions i mean! I really thought that whole thing was a myth a few years ago but it's really becoming so apparent now. Especially with kids.

It amazes me how I always feel so bad for the most horrible people.

It tough to focus when everything is so different I lived in downtown Tokyo before this! Yeah but I had spent extended time in the U.S. before. Still very different though!"
That's so cool. How did you get into football? I am obsessed but my girlfriend doesn't get it. So we need to swap places.( Just kidding). I love her anyway. How often do you two go?

"My lizard is named Gila. I have lots of houseplants that he likes to chill on. Do you have any pets?  I prefer lizards personally, but it's good that you've given so many cats a home. It must be a challenge keeping the litterboxes clean!  They probably would! Other than cat care, what do you do in your free time?  Ha, yes. Lots of Reddit here too. I like aww and whatisthisbug best.  I watch many lizard videos. Fewer antics than cats, but just as cute in their own way.  Yes! About as well as cats do.

But you know you have the mouse dilemma, if you live in Here you don't get killed or live in the city eating tasty. Well, if that's what you want for your life, welcome to the club friend! I've been 5 years now. hahahaha I understand you, here there is tranquility and without stress. but you miss the spectacle of the big cities."

"I would like more to live the adrenaline of life or death situations. I could do it, I would not say that it is an activity that I would like to do constantly. It certainly sounds like a pleasant activity with a partner like that. but I don't know just role-playing is exciting. Living as in the anime I see is great. without a doubt my number 1 is death note. The character of L is incredible. I have a community where we meet occasionally to play role-play. Super rewarding to share your hobbies with others. I would love to do it sometime, but I don't know if I can take so many looks in a place like that haha"

My niece who is in her early 20s, knows all the oldie musicians from my time. But I know all the song lyrics and sing along with them lol Are you in college?"

I'm allergic to them. Yup. In the North-East but grew up more toward the middle of the USA. I didn't grow up with pets so I never really got into owning pets until this whole salt water aquarium thing."
"The ornament is in the shape of a cat I sure am, I'm thinking of trying to find more of this type of ornament to add to it Thanks, Do you put up a tree?

Cats are so much wilier than rabbits. Rabbits, though, ate all my bell pepper plants this year, so they're on my list. I've never eaten rabbit. It seems like such a lot of work for so little. That's a good plan. I spread dried coyote urine in my garden to keep them out."

Yes, and I have read that vitamin C helps the formation of collagen, which I should think about because of my knee..  I recently had surgery after having pain in for a long time.  It still hurts but I am hoping that the surgery will benefit it in the long run.  The doc seems to think there may have been a mild previous injury that sped up wear and tear. I like to play some sports. "
